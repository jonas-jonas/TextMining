The 29-year-old lawmaker, who became the youngest women ever elected to Congress last November, is the most frequently mentioned Democrat on Fox News so far this year ‚Äî more than all of the potential Democrats in the 2020 presidential race."
">‚ÄúThink about the fact that every mainstream, leading Democratic contender is taking the advice of a freshman congresswoman who three weeks ago didn‚Äôt know the three branches of government,‚Äù Donald Trump Jr. said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know about you guys, but that‚Äôs pretty scary.‚Äù


Hey moron... i think it's your father that doesn't actually know that"
"Can‚Äôt wait for the current generation currently occupying government to die off, or be put in a home so we can laugh at the senile old politicians.

This shit pisses me off to no end.
Like seriously Don Jr.?!?! WTF have you contributed to the world you disgusting sack of shit.

Your father is a fucking moron and everything wrong with politics.  He‚Äôs a disgrace to your country and the office."
"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) responded on Friday to chants of ‚ÄúAOC sucks‚Äù that broke out at President Trump's rally in Michigan a day earlier, saying the president just want another woman to ‚Äúvilify.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt have another woman ‚Äî Hillary Clinton or whoever else ‚Äî to vilify anymore so they need to find another woman to kind of prop up and become a lightning rod,‚Äù the rookie lawmaker said.

Ocasio-Cortez's remarks came after the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., mocked the congresswoman at a rally for his father in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Thursday.
‚ÄúThink about the fact that every mainstream, leading Democratic contender is taking the advice of a freshman congresswoman who three weeks ago didn‚Äôt know the three branches of government,‚Äù Donald Trump Jr. said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know about you guys, but that‚Äôs pretty scary.‚Äù

After his remark, the crowd broke into the ""AOC sucks"" chant. 

‚ÄúYou guys, you‚Äôre not very nice,‚Äù Trump Jr. responded. ‚ÄúAnd neither is what that policy would do to this country.‚Äù"
"My hope is that AOC, and like minded politicians such as herself, continue to stand up for what they believe regardless of the bullying tactics of those such as Trump and his many MAGA supporters. The reality is that she, and other Democrats, represent an uncomfortable future that so many on the far right simply want to wish away.  "
"It worked for him the first time. 

He used all the shittiest parts of people to rile them up and make them realize that hating women and muslims and brown people and black people and being afraid of everything and the future and the unknown isn‚Äôt uncommon. That he hates those things too! And he‚Äôs afraid of those things too! And he‚Äôs rich so it *must* be okay! And that shit got him elected.

There‚Äôs no convincing people that stuff is wrong, but what you *can* do is get people to stuff their apathy and laziness for *one goddamned day* to vote his miserable ass out. "
"Most Republicans just don't want a woman for president.

https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/sixty-per-cent-trump-voters-dont-want-see-a-female-president-lifetime-poll-yougov-america-a8327061.html

Only 40% would vs. 95% of Democrats.

It really does boil down to old school sexism and racism (being white was biggest determinant of Trump support / Trump supporters were more motivated by ""change in social hierarchy"" than so called ""economic anxiety""). I know it's not a politically correct thing to say about Republicans, and they get easily offended to hear it, but it's really just telling it like it is.

The first step on the road to recovery is admitting you have a problem. "
"AOC aside, I think it's really weird that trump has spent his entire presidency campaigning. I mean I get it when presidents do a tour to drum up support for legislation, but it seems like trump has never stopped campaigning for election. "
I have honestly always found it interesting that Bernie is not really worth vilifying but AOC is from the view of the right. Like they have the exact same platform and both are exciting the younger crowd
It‚Äôs obvious they want another woman to hate. These people absolutely hate there is a women with an opposing opinion who is speaking her opposing opinion. I don‚Äôt understand why republicans are so fearful of women and require to have power over them. 
"So, I'm not a huge Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez fan.

I heard her on a talk show, making a joke about Trump being a nematode and I thought, ""Come on, you guys were supposed to bring some civility and dignity back to politics.""

Then I saw the ""AOC sucks"" chant and was reminded just how restrained and polite she really is being."
"It's not surprising these women hating asshats are the same ones voting against domestic violence protections for women, against women's healthcare equality, against equal pay, etc etc etc. The GOP is sick to its core."
"Nothing like someone who has a bar job to pay bills only to be called someone who hasnt found what they want to do in life, or havent been able to get where they want to be... then to get a job, work for the people and now be called someone who has no experience, isnt qualified, has no place in politics... I didnt know politics was a born into thing... smh"
"The 2016 election didn't just reveal that tens of millions of Americans are fucking morons, we also learned just how much tens of millions of Americans, including many millions of women, really hate strong women. And I'm not just talking about Clinton. Trump's attitude towards women has been horrifying for his entire adult life (even back when he donated money to Clinton's campaign). The ""grab them by the pussy"" recording would have been an immediate disqualifier for any Democrat. Sure, there were always rumors swirling during Clinton's husband's campaign but he never went on record saying something that disgraceful. Trump voters didn't even flinch."
"2004-2016 There was at least a SMIDGEN of respect between politicians, regardless of party affiliation. To have a sitting president encourage this kind of behavior tells you everything you need to know about their fan base and damaged moral compass. These people are literally only concerned with ‚Äústicking it to the other side‚Äù which comes in the form of bullying, plain and simple. Hats off to AOC for at least handling this with some grace before resorting to chanting and name calling.

Edit: Chanting not changing"
"They have to start tarring and feathering her now because if she keeps going the way she's going then *she will be running for president someday*. 

They're going to scrutinize every little thing. A missing apostrophe is going on translate to ""this little girl can't even spell"" meanwhile the base is buying the *n't* excuse. "
"Has anyone listened to the podcast Drilled? It's all about the decades long misinformation campaign by the oil industry to sow doubt in climate change and derail efforts to transition to a green economy. It's eye opening how deep their propaganda efforts have gone on the federal, state, and local levels, and around the world. 

I have no doubt they are at least somewhat involved with spreading hate for AOC and the Green New Deal. "
"I work for fedex, a lot of the truck drivers write Trump in the dirt on the backs of trailers, which I always remove because no politics allowed, but their new one is drawing  üö´ with aoc in the middle and it's just hilarious how childish it all really is."
"The 29-year-old lawmaker, who became the youngest women ever elected to Congress last November, is the most frequently mentioned Democrat on Fox News so far this year ‚Äî more than all of the potential Democrats in the 2020 presidential race.

"
"Really? That's the level of political engagement from Trump and his ilk? 'AOC sucks'?

I'd like to live in a world where the guy in charge of the nuclear codes of a global superpower, and the people that listened to him, approached government in a way that didn't resemble an insecure six year in a school playground."
"An attractive minority woman who decided to do something about the awful state the world is in instead of indulging in futile rage.


Makes sense they'd hate her. She's like the exact opposite of them."
That‚Äôs an interesting criticism coming from a man who‚Äôs father (the president) repeatedly showed during each of his debates and multiple times in office that he doesn‚Äôt have a basic understanding of how the American federal government operates.
"'""Think about the fact that every mainstream, leading Democratic contender is taking the advice of a freshman congresswoman who three weeks ago didn‚Äôt know the three branches of government,"" Donald Trump Jr. said. ""I don‚Äôt know about you guys, but that‚Äôs pretty scary.""'

Yeah, because your own thick as fuck family has so much experience in government..."
"Yes, he does, and it will work because the personal moral values of Republicans aligns with such actions.

&#x200B;

What am I saying!? Am I saying that categorically every single Republican by definition has heartfelt ethics which allow them to remain in a political quorum led by a violent mendacious racist? **Yes I am saying exactly that because it's true by definition**. So are you saying all Republicans are violent mendacious racists? **No of course not, I'm saying they all** ***support*** **violent mendacious racism** and that's enough to judge them as despicable."
"I think people are still missing what Trump is about.  Trump is about nothing.  He says things and gauges their response.  Big response, he'll say it again.  No response, he'll tweak it.  Still no response, he'll continue to tweak, toss it in the trash, or attempt to recycle it at a later date.

The reason Trump talks about AOC is not because he necessarily cares about her but because his base does.  So if he talks shit about her, his base is thrilled."
That whole family is full of assholes. And it's funny that a man ( and I'm using that term very lightly with JR) who made his career riding the coat tails of a con man who continually has to claim bankruptcy is acting like he's more intelligent than her. That whole family should be exiled back to their illegal imigrant mother's home land.
"Well if Trump and the Right need a woman to vilify so much that they want to focus all their attacks and energy on a Junior member of the House in her 20s with very little actual power, go right ahead???

That just opens the lanes for everyone else in the party to actually get shit done"
"Serious question, demanding a response- how often has Donald given a woman an orgasm? Statistically, how often do his supporters?

The whole American culture seems to vilify any normal men and glorify Regan-era cowboy factory workers that can‚Äôt get any."
"The sheeple against her are utterly pathetic. A bullys minions. A fucking loser bully at that. Fact. You sheeple are an embarrassment. Youve been whipped into a frenzy to protect the rich that enslave your stupid asses, and youre far to lowly and dumb to even know it. Her ideas would give YOU a better life. Shes smart enough to know this. You are pointless godless meatbags, like your fake news channel and your fake president. Deplorably stupid."
"I wonder what her father thinks. I know if I was her father I would be speaking loudly about some pencil neck dweeb talking sh*t. I get it's politics, but who the f*ck is McDonald Trump Jr compared to anyone, much less her. "
"Why must everything be about identity politics? I don‚Äôt like AOC, it has nothing to do with her gender and everything to do with her arrogance and ignorance. Pretty sure most people that don‚Äôt like her feel the same way."
"I would reply ""Damn right!  If your goal is to devalue Americans, rip them off, take away their healthcare, lock up their children and force them to pay your international tariffs.  If those are your goals, I'd think I suck too.  However, if preserving all those things are your goal, you'd probably think I'm pretty great.""

forgot ""and vilify the media"""
"His ideology is truly a fascist one. When ideology is rooted in scapegoating and requiring a constant villian. You know your beliefs are shit. When your character is rooted in, not your self and beliefs and philosophy beyond finger pointing and reactionary policy. Your ideology is shit and you can only lead morons. 

He's afraid of people like her. Which is good, because he and other reactionaries fucking should be."
What government official has ever made you proud of how they spend your money? Y‚Äôall realize that as she passes this new bill for increased taxes in 8 years~ republicans will return to power with new found monetary gains thanks to these intermediary ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù policies. Do you trust those people to control that money? Have any faith that AOC is gonna kick Google or Apple for not paying taxes? Is she gonna ban their products when they flee to other markets as tax havens? Her inexperience goes both ways she has no past to criticize but she also has no track record to instill faith in a traditionally broken and criminal system. I‚Äôm not willing to risk my incentive to work hard for her idealism. 
AOC is on pace for POTUS. Minus any significant scandal or allegiance to a communist or socialist party. She is masterful at maneuvering around the Cornering questions  like "are you a socialist?". While maintaining her stand on socialist programs. The pendulum will swing back far enough to allow room for this. 
"I really don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs a woman, her policy is basically everything trump stands against and she has a very big voice in politics. Making everything about sex just perpetuates sexism. Is it even possible in this climate to criticize her without being called sexist by somebody?"
Watching Trumps base be so quickly brainwashed into hating this woman makes me weep for humanity. Constantly calling someone stupid who is a million times more articulate and educated than Trump while simultaneously worshipping him is so gross to witness.
"Cute way to play the sex card. But Trump vilifies everyone. All his enemies.

Look at the way he insulted his way into the White House - he slammed 18 GOP candidates calling them low energy, short, stupid etc. Alexandria is just wrong.

Even Hillary said so:

‚ÄúTrump is an equal opportunity insulter‚Äù -Hillary Clinton"
"What is he referencing here? What makes him say she doesn‚Äôt know the three branches of government? I would think there would have to be something she said or did that they‚Äôre misconstruing here, but you never know with the Republicans. It really could just be totally made up out of nowhere, but I suspect they‚Äôre taking something wildly out of context and warping it beyond recognition to make their ‚Äúpoint‚Äù. "
"It worked on hillary. Republicans saw the first woman who could ever be president and savaged her endlessly. No one could really say why Hillary was ‚Äòcrooked‚Äô that didn‚Äôt apply 10x to Trump...but they just ‚Äòknew‚Äô she was because of the constant lies.

Edit: Oh man this comment sure triggered the trolls to come out from under the bridge. Where did they post it?"
"United States culture is still pretty unfair to women with power, and many simply aren't aware of it. They are expected to act and conduct themselves in very particular ways, and if they do not then they get criticized relentlessly. Take Hillary: complaints abounded that she ""sucked energy out of the room,"" or ""had a shady/inauthentic veneer."" Women are not allowed to have on a professional face or they are somehow not trustworthy. Also, there are double standards whereas men are forgiven for being dicks to subordinates, but if a woman of power is caught doing that then she is ""a total bitch"" and must not be forgiven. Women are expected to be flawless to compete."
"I don't listen to conservative radio at all, but in their defense even Democrats have been saying this stuff about Hillary for 30+ years. People in Bill Clinton's cabinet made comments about her after he left office saying pretty much the same thing- she's deceitful and opportunistic. I really think there's some truth to the claims of her dishonesty. In fact when she faced Obama in the 2008 primary she tried pulling that classic Hillary shit on him, too. 

Following some primary drama with the state of Michigan, all of the Democratic candidates (including Hillary) pledged not to campaign in Michigan and they all agreed that its results would not count. Many of the candidates, including Obama, even removed themselves from the ballot. Hillary didn't, but still agreed that the results were meaningless. 

Then afterwards when Hillary ""won"" a state where most others weren't even on the ballot, she formally tried to get Michigan's results to count- as she was on the ballot- and said that it was the fault of the other candidates for removing themselves from the ballot. 

*When pressed by NPR, Clinton said, ""We all had a choice as to whether or not to participate in what was going to be a primary, and most people took their name off the ballot but I didn't."" Critics have labeled Clinton's actions as dishonest, and charged her with trying retroactively to change the rules for her own benefit.*

So this isn't just a Republican thing- even fellow Democrats have called her out on her dishonest methods. I think the reputation is deserved. 



"
"Exactly!

Those rallies should be more accurately referred to as HATE rallies because that is just what they are. Trump uses hates rallies as his personal safe space, to stir up animosity towards anyone he perceives as a threat, and as his own platform to push his stochaistic terrorism.

Trump knows exactly what he's doing at those hate rallies - he taps into his supporters own personal hatreds to manipulate the right wing crowds to his own ends.  

And he evidently is good at what he does e.g. he's been clocked at telling a lie every 3 minutes and yet his followers hang on to his every lie as though it were Gospel truth."
"I hear you and I agree. But it has a lot less to do with age than it feels like. Remember it‚Äôs about the rich people trying to consolidate power and be greedy, and racism. Those are the two main factors imo. I just want us to keep our targets straight here "
What do you think those fucks children are going to be doing with the millions they've hidden away? Time isn't going to fix this bullshit. Vote them out and change the legal bribery that is current lobbying.
"Yeah, but here's the problem: Jr. is not of the ""senile"" generation we all are awaiting to die.  Look at these ""hate rallies"" and you see a lot of younger people.  As the nation's educational system has been supplanted by religious and charter schools -- let alone the homeschool/anti-vax crowd -- they are churning out more ""poorly educated"" than ever.  Don't for a minute think this is not part of the plan."
"I'm pretty sure that AOC knew more about the structure of government at 16 years old than DTJ will ever know in his entire life. I'm pretty sure she knew more than he'll ever know about anything, outside of being a scammy sleezy slimeball."
You must have been living under a rock to think calling someone a nematode is uncivil. Where‚Äôs the outrage over congressman quoted hitler? Yet the right cries crocodile tears and projects and gaslights and people are ok with it because the right isn‚Äôt being held accountable. AOC is trying to change that so fuck civility.
"> ""Come on, you guys were supposed to bring some civility and dignity back to politics.""

That's never been AOC's job and she's never advertised herself as such. She's a fighter and doesn't back down from anyone. We need people like that. Not people feeding us platitudes about ""civility"" and ""dignity"". What does that even mean?"
"I'll be honest. I read your first two bits and got pretty upset. I was getting a whole rant locked and loaded.

But then your last bit.

I totally agree. In a time when the president insults people in disgusting ways basically every day, including military veterans and families, a member of Congress making an innocuous, off-the-cuff joke on a comedy show is not what we need to be worried about."
"I mean, at this point EVERY main target the conservative media launches into a frenzy over has been a woman. First Clinton, now AOC. 

I suppose it's just a coincidence they didn't go after Beto like this, or Biden, etc. 

Funny isn't it, it's almost like.. something is protecting them from conservative hate. Hrm.."
"Exactly this. I'm really sick of people on this site claiming if you're a Republican you MUST just be sexist, racist, and stupid. The same people working against generalizing people based on a group they belong to are so quick to do this based on party lines. I don't care if AOC is a woman, man, or anything. It just so happens that this person with, in my opinion, horrible policy is a woman. Just throwing this out there too, she's literally said being factually correct is less important than being morally right in an interview with Anderson Cooper. That's not the type of person I want making any important decision. I want policy decisions based on fact. Also, more people need to read into the Green New Deal. It's good in theory, but when you really look into specifics, it's literally impossible to execute and almost embarrassing to put forward. "
In a way I‚Äôm kind of glad that AOC has become a lightning rod for their bullshit. It‚Äôs not like her district will ever vote her out and any time they spend yelling about her is time they‚Äôre not tearing down presidential nominees. Plus I think a lot of millennials connect with her and the more the GOP attacks her the more they alienate those demographics 
"Fox uses her as socialist boogeyman - not necessarily a female boogeyman (that's just a bonus). They use a pretty simple strategy of taking the most extreme example of socialist policies and attempting to apply the ""socialist"" label to the entire Democratic party by association. Fox also loves writing articles about congresswoman Omar - she's a democrat, a woman, and wears a hijab - it's a Fox dream - a scary three-fer that gets the base really riled up."
"This is blatantly false, my Facebook feed is filled to the brim if people cheering on AOC, and it's quite similar to Bernie Sanders during 2016. It's insane, even here on Reddit you see the love flowing for her, articles all over talking about her and how big the green new deal is when it first came out. Conservatives in media are reactionary."
"She's not that great, but she's not bad either. I honestly don't get the hype or the hate. She's alright as far as congress goes. I guess she just has a big personality and that drives conservatives crazy."
"Pelosi has taken a huge amount of shit. What are you talking about? The whole ""Nancy"" saga, for instance.

They tried to set her up as the next Hillary, but she actually has power so it was backfiring badly. That's when they shifted to someone they could make into an extremist bogey(wo)man who didn't actually have the power to shit on their policies."
I'm fairly sure Pelosi is calling the play here. AOC was always going to push a solidly left agenda but the timing of the green new deal and other "controversial" statements is probably part of the Democratic plan for 2020. AOC draws attention from the wackos leaving Pelosi free to be moderate to moderate/left and appeal to the "I vote for the economy and stability" crowd.
"Purely anecdotal but if it wasn't for conservatives and conservative media constantly mentioning her, I probably would have no idea who AOC is. 

I didn't really hear much a peep about AOC on other news sites/channels to make her memorable or stick out."
"Trump in and of himself is a problem in that he thinks he knows everything, you can't teach someone who thinks they know everything which means they can't learn, which means they will make mistakes and blame others because heaven forbid their ego admit they didn't actually know everything about everything.    


The best leaders are the ones who surround themselves with people who not only are smarter than themselves but everyone knows it and admits it.  Nobody can know everything about everything so people who are experts in their areas of expertise need to be consulted and have that information be meaningful.  It's why when the intelligence community tells Trump something he instantly disbelieves it because he knows best due to his ego being in the way.  Ego is the most dangerous trait of any leader which is why Trump is so horrible a ""leader"" big ball of ego.  "
"It‚Äôs a big assumption that marital fidelity matters to them. It‚Äôs a huge hangup for many Americans, sure, but not all. 

I mean that kind of insult might work in a five year old, but... hmm. 

Ok. Maybe you‚Äôre right. "
"My brother learned about AOC recently on Fox. All he knows about her is a) he hates her, b) she is the leader of the Socialist Party, c) she wants Sharia law (I think he thinks she and Ilhan Oman are the same person), d) she wants to ban guns and hamburgers, and e) she wants it to be legal to kill babies after they‚Äôre born because Democrats get off on murdering children. 

You have to realize that this is the average intelligence of a Fox News Republican. They have no idea who anyone on the Left is or what they do, they just know there are literally evil, demonic beings on the other side and they‚Äôre at the tipping point of a Christian Holy War with the world and a Holy Civil War at home against Satanic Nazi Socialist Muslim Planned Parenthood Atheists. They really believe this. My brother thought Planned Parenthood was a place that only ‚Äúkilled babies‚Äù until he found out from a fellow philandering Christian that he could go in secret to PP to ask them about the boils and pits on his dick and hide it from his wife, in true Christian  Republican fashion. Let me make sure you understand: he thought that it was a place that secretly has a chamber where they murder living babies, and that his tax dollars go towards it because Liberals simply have a lust for blood and enjoy murdering babies, and that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs videos of it.‚Äù

Fox is the Two Minutes Hate and AOC is Emmanuel Goldstein."
"Well, Hillary has decades of policy and business dealings that they could at least manipulate to seem ‚Äúcrooked.‚Äù

With AOC, they‚Äôre basically vilifying a newborn baby (in political terms).  She has no political past to rip apart, and seemingly no business dealings to cause legal trouble over.

It‚Äôs why their attacks of her are so monumentally stupid (even for them): they‚Äôre trying to get blood from a rock; a savage, burn-delivering, word-murdering rock. "
"Well, from the very little over read about that Q-Anon stuff, she eats babies and bathes in the blood of the innocent to revive her ""powers"" and uses baby blood as a drug to fuel her high. So, I could see people being upset about her. 

And yes, this is what some people actually believe, which both scares and amazes me. Hate is a powerful drug. "
"That's what I never understood about the ""Never Hillary"" voters that voted for Trump. All their concerns about Hillary were just as valid with Trump. To this day, none of the people that voted that way can articulately explain why they voted for Trump over her or anyone else."
"but they've also proved all that have to proclaim is ""AOC will eat your babies and give free things to poor non white people"" and the Fox base eats it up

my entire fb wall is full of ""they want to give illegal immigrants x and y, where is decent pay for teachers"" and they're happy to share it because ""they saw it on the news it must be true"""
"Also, think of it this way -

Republicans have no shame in lying and tarnishing someone's reputation. But Democrats CAN'T shut that shit down, hard.

Why? Well, we on the Liberal side of the spectrum believe in evidence-based discussion and coming to the truth, which is always a shade of gray. Even if the Republicans are blowing a story out of proportion, you'll have an endless amount of liberals saying ""Well, even if they're over-blowing it, it IS true..."" or ""Well, you know, SOME aspect of this story is true."" or the most infuriating: ""They're completely wrong, but I can see where they're coming from.""

So, on the liberal side we never really ever fight back as hard against the lies as they do to propagate it. What happens is that the republicans sustain the lie so long and so loudly, that eventually it becomes subconscious in the mind of the voters. And in that small grey area of the Liberal mindset, the Republicans live to exploit.

Hilary is a great example. She really didn't do anything of scandal... but they complained and bitched about her so much that when a small, potential scandal came - the backlog of bile suddenly seemed justified to a large portion of the populace. Even if it wasn't true. Even if it WAS true but blown out of proportion - republicans know how to sow the seeds of doubt in voters and they're doing it with AOC because there must ALWAYS be a boogey man and the 'secret shadow government' excuse could only take them to 2018."
"They also do this to Nancy P.

I think the best thing I ever heard about her is ""she is political poison and she should not be leader of the house""

Someone respond ""who ever is leader of the house will be poisoned politically by Fox and Republicans. She is already poisoned and proved she can continue to lead with that much against her we should keep her as house majority"" "
"I remember some liberals in this sub in 2016 were saying things like ""I don't need to prove it"" or ""be able to explain it"" because ""I can *feel* she's crooked and I'm sure my instincts aren't wrong!""

I imagine those are the handful of ""liberals""   who voted Stein or wrote in Bernie or stayed home in order to elect Trump."
"The repugs' oxygen is fear. And when they are cornered, faced with truth, exposed with their own shit... They lash out. They play that ""I know you are but what am I"" kinda game. It's the typical bully attitude. And they know AOC is a threat. Because she's so much smarter and doesn't back down and has confidence and strength. And to them, that scares them.. So they wail and flail with their bullying hate. They also are the types that believe in gender roles and think of women less, let alone people of color. It isn't about America to them.. A lot is about making Wypipo great again. Their radicalized minds won't allow them to accept truth or their hypocrisy. Bullies have too much pride to ever feel wrong. They don't like getting punched in the mouth in ways that AOC can easily do, over and over. "
"Hey man, even as a Canadian, Hillary kinda sucked as a candidate. Yeah, the republicans smeared her for years. Yes it worked. Yeah, they democrats still tried to force her in.

Maybe this time, they don't try some stupid shit like that, and hopefully you don't reelect the biggest moron in north america."
"Of *course* their criticism of Hillary wasn't sexism! Look at all their convincing arguments! All her questionable actions! Her emails!

Wait Donald Trump has done literally everything they accused Hillary of doing?

Well she was a woman."
">No one could really say why Hillary was ‚Äòcrooked‚Äô that didn‚Äôt apply 10x to Trump

This is the thing right here.  I mean yeah, Hillary was extremely off-putting, and I get that, but to then turn to someone like Trump?  Everything they hate about Hillary they love about Trump so it's all just partisan nonsense.  It's the power of propaganda. "
Oh they'd say why she was crooked.  But they were all crack pot conspiracy theories about how she was having people killed.  Or the whole uranium one thing where they said she took money from the Russians.  They cant prove anything but they dont need to as in their minds it's true. Like pizzagate.  it was true enough to one guy that he charged into a pizza place to save the sex slaves HRC was hiding in its nonexistant basement.
"I'm not a troll but I'm a bit older and remember this stuff when it was happening when Bill Clinton was president. 

Back then even Democrats were weary of Hillary. She had no role in government but she was annoying everyone with her opportunistic and deceitful personality. This was before she even ran for senator. When she did run for Senate, her Democratic opponents said the same thing about her. Later in 2008 when she ran for Democratic nominee for president, she pulled similar sneaky shit and people pointed out that she was dishonest. 

I think in this case she just is a dishonest person."
"Just look at her approval ratings throughout her life. Fine when she was First Lady; tanked when she ran for Senate. Fine when she was a Senator; tanked when she ran for President. Fine when she was SoS; tanked again when she ran for President.

It's like America has a problem with women seeking power or something."
"It‚Äôs the same reason Obama had to be the most mild, milqtoast president ever. Women and people of color have to be model citizens because they are held to the standards of the worst stereotypes about them. White dudes are just ‚Äúthe norm‚Äù and can do whatever the fuck they want. "
"She has HRC's experience to go on, and her youthful ambition allows her to not give a shit like HRC gave a shit.  


HRC was the victim of a vast, right wing conspiracy. AOC will effectively use that as a class in how to respond to the same forces."
"They will turn over every rock they can. They will hold her to a standard few others will face. It's the same thing with Omar. 

Republican's will ignore members who laud white supremacy and quote Mien Kampf but shout antisemitism at the Dems from the steps of the capital."
"Reddit has a popular misconception that America's political culture will change as the Baby Boomers die out. In fact, the same themes of race (white supremacy) and gender (patriarchy) and inequality (towards more 1% capitalism) that have shaped America since 1776 will remain with us. This is thanks to a massive amount of white, Millennial men, ~22 million or 1/3 of the largest voting bloc now. Democrats need to find a way to reach these young, white men.

Our system of Federal and state governments also allows a minority to maintain power once it seizes control of DC and state capitals, and that is exactly what the Republicans have done. After some time, voting will no longer be effective in removing them from power.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/12/15/racial-resentment-is-why-41-percent-of-white-millennials-voted-for-trump-in-2016/

> Most millennials voted for Clinton, as predicted.

> But when we disaggregate the millennial vote by race and ethnicity we find some interesting things ‚Äî including, notably, that **41 percent of white millennials** voted for Donald Trump in 2016.

> First, white millennial Trump voters were likely to believe in something we call ‚Äúwhite vulnerability‚Äù ‚Äî  the perception that whites, through no fault of their own, are losing ground to other groups. Second, racial resentment was the primary driver of white vulnerability ‚Äî even when accounting for income, education level or employment.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/11/05/majorities-of-millennials-who-plan-to-support-democrats-except-among-white-men/

> Meanwhile, about 69 percent of millennial white women likely to vote support the Democratic candidate, almost 30 points more than the 40 percent of white millennial men who do. A majority of white millennial men support their Republican candidate, compared with only about a quarter of white millennial women.

> About 73 percent of millennial men of color, 77 percent of women of color and 68 percent of white women strongly disapprove of Trump, while only 38 percent of millennial white men do."
I think he's reading the emotion of the crowd and playing into it but not really for an agenda exactly. Trump desperately wants love and approval. It's embarrassing how obvious that and his narcissism are.
"And that time he raped Ivana and pulled her hair out, which is documented in court record. Or that time he and Epstein got into a fight over who was going to rape the virgin 13 year old first, the testimony of which is also documented in court record. (Spoiler : Epstein raped her first, then Trump got mad and rage-raped her when he found out. )

"
"What I like about AOC is that (1) she is extremely intelligent, (2) has extremely strong charisma, (3) is extremely attractive and (4) extremely powerful.

The special thing about these characteristics is that they are the exact characteristics which drive *red-pilled* conservatives into an emasculated rage. This woman needs real security because she will be a target of these men who feel extremely insecure that a woman of this calibre is rising so rapidly through the world of politics."
"> Plus I think a lot of millennials connect with her and the more the GOP attacks her the more they alienate those demographics

This is especially true when the GOP attacks her for what they describe as a lack of ""real life experience."" It isn't a good look for the people who ripped economic opportunity away from Millennials to be attacking one for not being ""successful"" enough."
"""Think about the fact that every mainstream, leading Democratic contender is taking the advice of a freshman congresswoman who three weeks ago didn‚Äôt know the three branches of government,"" Donald Trump Jr. said. ""I don‚Äôt know about you guys, but that‚Äôs pretty scary.""

And this coming from someone with no political education or experience and a known security risk, that's almost funny if it wasn't so scary. "
"The problem is... The GOP doesn't have a shot with people who like AOC anyway.

The GOP has a gigantic electoral advantage that is growing every year. Every year the smart people move out of bumfuck rural areas and into big cities where the jobs are, concentrating the nation's senatorial and electoral votes into vast swaths of emptying, ignorant, and jobless lands. AOC is a lightning rod alright. These people vote with anger and hatred. The GOP knows all they have to do is put AOC on full blast 24/7, and the midwest will get angry at *all* Democrats by association, and come out to loudly and proudly vote R. 

These fuckers know exactly what they're doing."
"Yes in some ways it is great and it only makes her more popular with her base. But I fear it too. They are so obsessed with vilifying her and at the same time radicalizing their viewers and brainwashing them into believing that Democrats are the enemy and a national threat to this country. There are probably at least a 100 MAGA bombers out there watching Fox News vilify AOC everyday. It is only a matter of time before something happens. 

Hopefully she has top notch security. We need to do something about the right wing extremist propaganda that is allowed to be broadcast by Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, etc. Because right now they won't stop vilifying her until its too late and even then they will continue to vilify her. It is fucked up that they don't care, and even some that vilify her may actually want something bad to happen."
"Shoulda learned from trump. There‚Äôs no such thing as bad publicity. Her name is out there which automatically makes her more influential just by more people hearing her words. 

It used to be, ‚Äúit ain‚Äôt what you know, it who you know‚Äù

To ‚Äúit ain‚Äôt who you know, it‚Äôs how many people know you‚Äù 

"
"Im kind of ok with it. I optimistically (maybe stupidly) hope that this pisses off the younger/newer voters. Hillary being the bogeyman I can understand as an easy target, but she was a lot older, maybe not as in touch with the younger generation, or they simply didnt care. AOC is one of them though,  hell its weird seeing a politician younger than myself and Im only 35. I hope that these attacks look as transparent and pathetic to the newer voters as it does myself."
"It worked with Clinton. Everyone in middle American may have known who she was, but a majority of those bumpkins believed she was the devil.

They‚Äôre elevating AOC for the same reasons. She‚Äôs an even easier target though because she‚Äôs young, progressive and non-white, which is particularly scary for old white. "
"She wants health care for all AND a plan of action to prevent global climate crisis. Not to mention getting dark monied interests out of politics!? The nerve of the woman to go against the status quo!!"
"Ah, the Judas Goat/Wizard Of OZ Strategy: distract with the loud  attractive nuisance, while the people who have real power get shit done quietly behind the scenes. Hey, it's been working for the Republicans with Trump for the past three years, why shouldn't the folks with the *less* evil agenda steal from the other side's playbook - especially when it *obviously* works so well?"
"This play calls itself: AOC & Ilhan Omar are lightning rods to test new ideas & go twitter-to-twitter with Trump & the media cabal; meanwhile Pelosi, Schumer, Schiff, Waters, Warren, etc. are freed up to advance the mainstream DNC agenda, launch supoenas & investigations.  "
"You're completely right.  It's almost like they have a history of doing exactly that.

In short, she was talking about taking back the three major elections (house, senate, presidency) and a bunch of idiots who apparently don't realize you don't get elected to federal courts or the supreme court thought she was talking about branches of government.

https://splinternews.com/conservative-nerds-desperately-try-and-fail-to-dunk-on-1830535252"
"Oh man. It‚Äôs obviously just a misspeak. You can‚Äôt, through elections, take back the judicial branch. So she‚Äôs just clearly referencing the three parts of elective government that Democrats can regain control over through voting: house, senate, presidency. It‚Äôs sad to me that they just search through every moment of her life for a time when she misspeaks or makes an understandable error in the moment, and then latch onto it and attempt to demolish her over and over and over. She has no peace, she is subject to their furor at every step. Oh well, at least her ‚Äúmisspeaks‚Äù are innocent and understandable and, ultimately, not indicative of some deep seated inability to perform her job. Not like being caught on tape saying you grab women by their pussies. Amazing to me the double standard for these people, if you can even call it that. A recording of her mischaracterizing, on accident, the various branches or chambers or sections or whatever you want to call them or government or congress, is something they froth at the mouth over while a recording of their glorious leader talking about and glorifying sexual assault is just locker room talk. Makes me sick. "
"They just call her stupid, naive, socialist etc... with no sense of irony and it does work. We have to realise that 30% of the US is a lost cause and its voter turnout of the rest of the country that should be focused on"
">Well, Hillary has decades of policy and business dealings that they could at least manipulate to seem ‚Äúcrooked.‚Äù

I think this is the fundamental problem here. Hillary was investigated extensively and no wrongdoing was found. Yet the right wing propaganda machine is so powerful that they could still make it **seem** as if she was corrupt.

Until we as a society become experts at separating the bs from the real news, all of our candidates will be vulnerable to fake outrage and manufactured scandals. AOC is not an exception."
"Sure, she doesn't have the same baggage. She also doesn't have the same on camera presence that Hillary does. Hillary often came off as disingenuous or manufactured/robotic. AOC seems totally genuine and is comfortable with answering tough questions even ""gotcha"" questions."
"They were picking on Hillary her whole political career too, Hell they were going for her during her husbands political career because they knew she was a threat. They didn't just start when she ran for President.    "
Hillary was the first lady trying to get health care done in the 90s. Usually first ladies aren't vilified like that but there were so many sexist comments about her. I remember noticing that shit when I was 9 and it stood out to me hearing someone else ask why she want just making cookies and hosting parties.
I see fb posts every day that mock her and try to make her look stupid in the most substanceles ways. They mostly equate to awkwardly timed photos of her that say derp on them. It's the best they can come with and the tools just eat it up.
"They started to vilify Hillary when she was still the governess wife. They kicked it into high gear when she won the NY senate seat but they  didn't need a record to start in on Hillary, and they don't need a record to begin the smear campaign on AOC either. As a record builds they will use it, but the GOP is just planting seeds right now. "
"This concept is essential to a debate tactic known as the Gish Gallup. Basically, you throw a metric fuckton of completely untrue, but sensationalist, bullshit at your opponent. Since these claims are easy to create because they're totally made up, they can be crafted at lightning speed.

To refute these untrue claims with ACTUAL truth takes a great deal of time and, unfortunately, is usually a bit more boring than the sensational lies. This exponentially increases the value of the Gish Gallup tactic because not only can the refuter not keep up with the liar's pace, but they also cannot adequately compete with the liar for the audience's attention."
"In 2016 [r/politics was upvoting Breitbart articles to the top](https://i.imgur.com/tY51qUh.jpg), as long as they shat on Hillary. There are other snapshots like this with Fox News, Sputnik, and HA Goodman.

Don't be surprised to see this repeated with AOC some day."
"It was absolutely ridiculous that these criticisms, no matter how accurate or overblown or just plain invented, were used as a reason to vote against her *when the alternative was Donald J. Trump*. Trump is by no metric qualified to POTUS, and it was monumentally stupid for people to risk his winning the election and ruining the functioning of the U.S. government because they had a 'feeling' about Clinton. Yes, Hilary Clinton was the sort of Democrat to be mixed up in negative political activities, but DJT had no governing or public service experience whatsoever, and was well known for reneging on promises and neglecting responsibilities; his candidacy was inappropriate. The fact that he came close to a majority of votes in such a way that he won through the electoral college system is absurd. It should not have even been close. "
"People do not need to forget that the Russian campaign (as far as I know and from what I have read) did not JUST want to help Trump. They also helped Bernie. They tried to divide both parties using the 2 ""fringe"" candidates. The #BERNIEORBUST hashtag if I remember correctly was directly pushed by the bots. 

Their main goal was to sow discord. It worked far better than they could have hoped. Not only did Hillary lose... tons of Democrats helped Trump win. By either staying at home, writing someone else in or just straight up voting for Trump.

I liked Bernie and will be voting for him again. But please everyone read up on things. Not just vote straight one side of the ticket or vote with your ""feelings"""
"Awhile back someone mentioned how fake it was that on the 2016 campaign trail Hillary said he carried hot sauce in her purse.  Someone commented how that was so fake of her and I linked to this 1993 article, https://www.vanityfair.com/news/1993/06/hillary-clinton-first-lady-first-100-days showing that does indeed carry hot sauce around with her and the response was bascially that they still felt she was being fake about her answer.  When people have made up their mind on something, it's hard to change it even with evidence, unfortunately opinions often change very slowly when it comes to politics."
"You know, many people are saying... I don‚Äôt know if I believe it, but MANY people are saying that they‚Äôre actors. Have you heard that? Lots of people are saying it. The Koch Brothers put up ads on Craigslist, Sean Hannity probably runs... get this folks... subliminal ads during his program, and bing bing bong bong... you have a full rally. You know most people haven‚Äôt even learned the word subliminal, but I know all about it. They tell me that they don‚Äôt even make the signs themselves but are given them as they walk off the bus. Does that sound familiar folks? Sad!"
"Even if Trump Sr only got to where he is because he got money from his dad, is the biggest bullshitter in history and knew how to market himself at least he did that. Trump Jr doesn‚Äôt even have that going for him. "
Definitely agree that AOC should step up her security because if those haters on the right have shown us anything is that they are definitely not averse to resorting to violence as a means of dealing with those they dislike intensely or they see as getting in the way of their agenda.
"I like how the most upvoted comments in this thread are people saying it's unfair that women can't be taken seriously in politics because they are women.

Then you literally put fucking ""things I like about her well, she's attractive!!"" In your gradeschool list. GTFO with that shit. If you like her don't bring her fucking looks into it.

You end it with how powerful she is. Do you know who she is or what her position in the government does? How is she ""extremely"" powerful? Were you just thinking of a different way to write charisma a second time?

If what you like about her is she smart and has charisma that's wonderful. Don't cap it off with ""AND A TOTAL BABE AMIRITE!"""
"> This is especially true when the GOP attacks her for what they describe as a lack of ""real life experience.""

after electing a guy with zero political experience... 

I told a friend of mine that it was amusing.. 

1.  she 'tells it like it is'

2.  she wants to shine a light on DC corruption

These were two big bullshit talking points that got Trump elected... she is actually doing what he claimed to do."
TIL being a dairy farmer is relevant life experience to be in top secret senate committees but having studied economics at a good university is still not enough to qualify you for a junior position in Congress.
agree but also she has policy that make sense in our changing world. They made a big list of what she wants to do on fox as to bash her ( some was obviously made up \*no planes) but all of it sounded great and they seemed to have a hard time going after it.
"She grew up being insulted constantly by Internet trolls, just like everyone my age and younger did.  (She's about 10 years younger than I am.)

Having this experience makes bullying far less effective.  The angry old people who watch Fox News underestimate how much bullying has blown itself out as a tactic in the public sphere."
"The GOP‚Äôs reaction to her is far more negative and also entirely undeserved but the Fox press coverage is similar in the coverage given to trump by the more leftist/centrist media channels during his campaign and well, currently still as well.

She‚Äôs in the news cycle all the time because of the GOP. And also because her responses are usually fire. "
"> who three weeks ago didn‚Äôt know the three branches of government,

What was his reason for saying this? Pure baseless speculation or was there some sort of speaking gaff from AoC that got twisted into this?"
"I think that's part of why they are so determined to attack her. There's been things she said a few months ago that my extremely conservative family was repeating. She was actually somewhat connecting in a way fox news did not expect her to when they 1st started reporting on her.

Of course, now she's the devil, and the mental hoops they'll jump through to deny anything she says is astounding."
"Another thing they might've learned is that people *love* it when someone shrugs off a shit storm and doubles down.  

On the other hand, whenever anyone acts like they're willing to re-think and compromise, they regard it as a sign of weakness, an admission of being wrong.    

"
"Yup. Most Americans are actually progressive. Read the polls and you'll quickly realize that. Fox News just brainwashes people to vote against their own self interest.

Fox seriously needs to be taken down from TV. They need to be deplatformed just like we deplatform alt righters and terrorists."
"A lot of people don‚Äôt know this...but we have a Republic with many branches of government, many branches, there‚Äôs the Senate, the Presidency, me *grin*, the courts and our big beautiful military, not the fake news media!"
"> It‚Äôs obviously just a misspeak.

This is Republican's favorite line of attack. Remember how Obama visited 47 states and was so used to saying ""The 50 States"" and then blurted out ""The 57 States"" in a moment of exhaustion that literally anyone could have made? They spent years saying Obama was so dumb he didn't even know there were 50 states. 

There is no stance that Republicans approach from a stance of honesty or integrity. Not one."
"I moved 3,000 miles away. That‚Äôs how I dealt with it. I abandoned my family (or vice versa) because I learned that you cannot fight the Republican machine, no more than I could stop him from eating sugar or drinking beer. It is a religion. You attack Trump, they take it more personally than if you attacked Jesus Christ or their own children. The energy spent on identifying their hypocrisy is wasted. 

To give you an example of how hopeless they are- my brother recently had a panic attack because his bank wouldn‚Äôt take his payment for a credit card even though collectors were calling him. ‚ÄúThey won‚Äôt take my money. I guess it‚Äôs not good enough for them.‚Äù

So I tried to help him with the situation. He said he called US Bank and the ‚Äúlady, probably in China or somewhere‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt help him, so he escalated to her manager, he couldn‚Äôt help him, so he flips out. He starts leaving threatening reviews. He starts calling lawyers. He calls me and says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm worried I will do something I regret‚Äù - he means killing them, because he owns like 200 guns- and says ‚Äúbut I‚Äôm praying about it.‚Äù After I help him figure out how to unlock his own phone, I realized that he has a Bank of America app- his account was at Bank of America and he had been calling US Bank.

Truly I don‚Äôt know how they can handle the basic tasks of life, and that is part of the problem and why Trump is so attractive to him. Life is so confusing to my brother (he‚Äôs 10 years older than me). Trump takes the confusion away. There‚Äôs good guys and bad hombres, etc. 

The world is progressing too quickly and passing him by and he hates it. He is perpetually furious because he cannot use basic technology.

He doesn‚Äôt understand that just because there are words on the internet it doesn‚Äôt mean the words are fact. It is very sad and I feel bad for him, but he has become so militant, mean, and violent that I have pretty much abandoned him."
"I love when people on my FB feed call her ""stupid"". Just the other day my boss did, and I had to ask about his college degree and political qualifications. He said, ""apparently neither of those things matter if she can do it."" His face went straight full speechless, 'yeah but' when I told him she has bachelor's from Boston College and graduated Cum Laude with degrees in Economics and International Relations. "
Yup. My mom called her a floozy. Said she‚Äôd was a bartender! Said she represents a small town in NY state. Guess the Bronx is a small town. The people that hate her have just been told to hate her. She really is the new bogeyman. 
"You‚Äôre not even kidding. It‚Äôs working like a fucking charm. Even some mildly conservative friends from high school share shit saying that AOC has no basic understanding of economics...cmon guys, you didn‚Äôt even graduate high school. How tf does this woman with a degree in economics know less than you? It‚Äôs embarrassing how well propaganda works."
"I really wish Dems would get this. My dad will never ever vote for you. Ever. I thought Trump might be a line he wouldn‚Äôt cross, but nope! I rarely try anymore to have some sort of dialogue and when I do I am full of regret. The last straw was Brett Kavanaugh and finally sharing my own feelings and experiences with sexual harassment and assault. There were a few glimmers of empathy but it was mostly a disparaging and insulting response. If I can‚Äôt get through to him, no one can. "
"Let me guess, you‚Äôve never seen footage of a young Hillary Rodham?

The media asked Hillary _retarded_ questions for decades. She‚Äôd be negotiating to rebuild after 9-11 and a reporter would ask her about Bill. And not Fox, every fucking reporter did that. 

So, she came off as robotic because the media was annoying as fuck to her and she looked stiff for not telling them off. If you ever catch a clip of her loosing it and berating a reporter for being a moron, she looks completely natural. 

It‚Äôs funny, Hillary ripped SNL a few new assholes and looked 100% authentic doing it. And they never crossed that line after. I bet it pusses Trump the fuck off that SNL stopped their bullshit after 1 scolding from Hillary and the nation laughs at Trump when he bitches about them. "
"My parents hate her but are unable to explain why. What kills me is they say she is destroying politics while saying Trump has done some good.

They're brainwashed and do not want to discuss it. They came to these conclusions without logic, logic won't sway them."
"Hillary had decades of this shit.  It's easy to appear genuine when you haven't had decades of people taking everything you do & say & twisting it & using it against you.   I love AOC I love her young energy but 20 years of that shit will have you watching what you say & do & being overly cautious in every public situation.  Also if you don't think Hillary is comfortable around tough questions, watch video her at one of her the many senate hearings they used to try to find yet another way to ""get"" something on her & how she keeps her cool under pressure. "
"This is important to remember, not so much because it happened, but because it will happen again, no matter the nominee.  If Bernie is leading the D primary, there's going to massive tons of divisive shit thrown at the other leaders in the primary to depress the vote in the general election.  It will happen with every other candidate too and unfortunately, a lot of Bernie supporters have been primed to not trust anyone other than Bernie, not all certainly I beleive the majority (by far) will vote for any Democrat, but it doesn't take many votes to flip a state."
"Ya ... it is not like the U.S. is an outlier when t comes to women and politics.

Loads of countries have never elected a female head of government, right?

Like Sauda Arabia, Afghanstan, Iraq, Cuba, Iran etc. "
"Don Sr has little idea how to market himself. He was a failed businessman reliant on mob connections  and exploiting others until The Apprentice. Until a TV show that was based on the premise that he was a successful businessman gave him the ethos that his bluster was given more credit than it's due. The fact that he's still reliant on the criminal element says something. 

You think he would have any success if he couldn't rely on people's confirmation biases of him as successful? "
"I mean, she is though.  Thats part of what the right hates about her, because she makes them feel insecure.  She is smart, strong, charismatic, understands social media, and is attractive.  Being attractive is honestly huge, because attractive people are intimidating.  Not only that, but when someone is attractive conservatives expect them to sit there and look pretty.  

Also, compared to 99.999999% of people, she is extremely powerful.  Most people aren't lawmakers...
"
"I mean, I don't think you understood my comment. You see, the first part of the list directly relates to the second part. I like her for those reasons *taken together* ie. that these  are characteristics that drive red-pilled conservatives into an emasculated rage.

She is exactly the kind of politician that they can not stand, a kind of Anti-Trump, if you will, or perhaps a Hillary mark 2."
"Let's not make that equivalent though.  The left/center reaction to Trump has been justifiably extreme and exhaustive because he's doing outrageous and terrible things pretty consistently, lying about all of them.  A borderline obsessive response to that is justified.

&#x200B;

Fox and the GOP acting like that about AOC is just fear and smear.  Just because the same thing is happening on both sides doesn't make it equal (which you didn't claim, I'm just wanting to clarify)."
"[It was a gaff](https://news.iheart.com/featured/glenn-beck/content/2018-11-21-glenn-beck-blog-ocasio-cortez-tries-to-name-3-branches-of-govt-fails-twice-then-blames-drooling-republicans/). Reading the quote, it seems like her brain just misfired."

I think that is just highlighting his own deficiency but the maga idiots will never check to find out the facts. Just follow blindly what they are told as long as there is a shout out at the end. "
"That's not the point.  How many people know her, now, because of fox?  

Fox won't shut up about her,  other people (us, here, included) respond so now more people know about her and her message.

If fox didn't obsess about her, we wouldn't be here."
"Because Walmart and McDonalds are closed on national holidays? The solution isn't that simple, and measures like fewer restrictions to registration, same day registration, voting by mail, and just having an appropriate number of polling places to cut down on long lines and commutes will be much more effective.  (Though I still think election day should be a holiday.

&#x200B;"
"This is one of those ideas that is better in theory than in practice. Making election day a holiday will be good for federal employees and people in the banking industry, and that's just about it. Feel free to stop by any business on any federal holiday that isn't Christmas and you can see all of the minimum wage employees working just like it's any other day.

Automatic registration and mail-in ballots are the way to go. "
"So, here's the thing, if election day is a national holiday, all the banks will be closed, and the law offices and financial planning services and so forth. But McDonald's will still be open. Walgreens will be open. The hospitals will be open. Bars, restaurants, miniature golf courses, full-size golf courses, tow truck services, movie theaters, convenience stores and so on... all open. 

So a voting holiday will do a lot to make it more convenient for white collar workers to vote, but it's not gonna do a thing for those whose work schedules present the biggest obstacles to voting. 

"
"Not just that, but when you show them the definition from the dictionary, you then find out that the dictionary itself is part of the global librul conspiracy against them! It's the entire fucking planet conspiring secretly against them, no joke. But they don't need therapy! Therapists are part of the conspiracy too!"
"I tried to help my dad see why ‚Äúgrab em by the pussy‚Äù and the Kravenaugh stuff bothered me by obliquely sharing some of my sexual trauma and his response was basically, ‚ÄúGet over it.‚Äù That was pretty crushing and I knew then there was no way back for him. Here was his youngest child and only girl confirming something to him that had been quietly suspected for over thirty years and it was irrelevant because Trump is king."
"They don't actually mean they want more money for teachers. They want no money for immigrants, and once that's accomplished, fuck the teachers, it's time for another tax cut that primarily benefits the rich!

The real victory though is the now-destitute immigrants of course. "
If you read transcripts of his interviews they rarely make any sense.  The man is actually incredibly stupid and I think he's probably losing his marbles as he gets older.  He makes absolutely no fucking sense most of the time when he's talking off the cuff. 
"The US is the only one that's sold as ""the land of opportunity"". I don't know what the ""Saudi Dream"" or the ""Afghani dream"" is, but I know the American Dream is undercut by it being so difficult for women to ascend to the highest seats in society. The key difference between those countries you mention and the US is that only one of them is seen as a light for liberty.

Note: other countries treating women unfairly is also very bad. You aren't wrong. Just it's not a direct comparison, and isn't very relevant when we are talking about women politicians in America."
"I for one agree with you. I was glad you wrote ‚Äúattractive‚Äù but not for the same reason you gave. Being attractive is an asset in life, period. I‚Äôm not a scientist but I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of studies that show how attractiveness impacts your success in life. And it‚Äôs kind of aggravating that you somehow can‚Äôt say a woman is attractive as a positive thing, to some people. I‚Äôm not well spoken on reddit so I hope I articulated this okay. Basically I‚Äôm saying being attractive IS a good thing, whether or not some people believe it is or isn‚Äôt. Let‚Äôs be honest if she wasn‚Äôt cute, republicans wouldn‚Äôt give a shit what she says. It‚Äôs putting her in the spot light and for the most part I like the message she‚Äôs putting out there. Get it girl. "
"> but when you show them the definition from the dictionary

I am one of those people who tries to choose my words carefully and more often than not will correct people on improper usage of words. In my experience people are very hostile when you tell them they are wrong, to the extent they will deny it and attack you for multitudes of reasons. I'm trying to help them and they attack me for it, it's unreal. Anti-intellectualism is far too prevalent and many revel in their willful ignorance."
"I'm still not sure it was even a gaff. It seems like more of an intentional misunderstanding from Fox news and The Donald. She said 3 chambers of government, referring to the three bodies that people get to vote for. I haven't been able to find another way that she should've said it. She corrected herself in the same moment from saying Congress to saying government. They all went crazy over, ""those aren't the three branches!!!"" when she never said branches at all. She only mentioned the number and parts of government.

Edit: If she had left off the end and said that there are two chambers that we vote for, they'd have said ""she doesn't know that we vote for president.""

"Why yes it's much better for the political class to be made up of all the same incestuous rich people that all went to the same private schools and universities, who all interned at their dad's friend's company, and have never had to worry about paying a bill in their life. "

"We don't need a national holiday, we just need vote by mail.  Oregon has had vote by mail since the late 80s.  I have never ever been to a polling location in my life.  I sit at my kitchen table and go through all the amendments and what not and then mail it in or drop it off.  Simple.

If we had a holiday, it would work but I suspect that those who don't care about voting would just take advantage of it and businesses will be all up in arms.  This is much less intrusive."

"What about a national voting week (monday to friday)? Not saying the entire week is to be taken off, but each employee has to have one day off on one of those days. That way, places dont have to shut down and if you are working two jobs, you can just talk to your work about getting the two days to match.

Edit: to expand on this, think about it like this:

I'm using Nov 2 to Nov 6, Monday to Friday. I believe having a defined pattern for voting week would be useful. Maybe the week of the first Monday of November, or something. Anyway

Have each employer choose a day off for each employee during this Monday-to-Friday period. Would just be like normal scheduling, but each employee HAS to have a day off between Monday and Friday of that week.

Employers would like the power, because it gives them the choice to either close completely on a day or run with partial teams. This way it's not really being FORCED on them. Employees would have an adjustable day that they can discuss with scheduling about getting evened between their two jobs,but wouldn't have to worry about upsetting their paycheck because it is just one day off."
">	This is one of those ideas that is better in theory than in practice.

There is always an airtight reason people come up with that the US *can‚Äôt* get something done that isn‚Äôt starting a war, disrupting another countries sovereignty or making guns more plentiful. 

We can do this, we just need to stop people sitting around saying why we *can‚Äôt.*"
I think a lot of people don't really grasp that the US doesn't have the kind of centralized government some nations do. There really is no such thing as a true "National Holiday" where the feds can mandate that nobody work. Even if there was it would always exempt essential services like healthcare and law enforcement. Elections are pretty much run by the states and there are other ways to make it easier for people to vote. I think the whole idea of having a single "Election Day" is antiquated. There is no reason you can't collect votes over a period of time by various sources. There just needs to be a deadline when the voting ends and the counting starts. 
CONSERVATIVES ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT. I had conservative parents who refused to let me see a therapist because they were afraid the therapist would say something that would undermine their beliefs and parenting skills.
"In my 37 years of life, from all I've experienced personally, everything I've read about throughout history... No one in their right mind can tell me that capitalism is not a greed enabling economic mechanism. From the 90s to about 2010 there was MAJOR shift in how full time and part time employment was distributed to low wage workers. Things like planned obsolesce does not exist for the benefit of humanity, just profit (minus a few examples), overall just purely to make lower quality products that break more often to need replacing. Used to be you could work a single full time job and have enough money to provide for a family, now you'd be lucky to not starve to death an be homeless, if you can even get a full time job."
"Damn - that's rough. Having family who went through something similar (but not due to Trump), I'm sorry you had to go through that. For them, how our family reacted was worse that the event itself.

"Yep. Basically, one story I shared was going to a bar when I was 18 to watch a cover band. While I was standing near a wall, an older man pinned me against it so I couldn't move, put his tongue in my mouth, licked my face and neck, while groping my chest, and using his legs to force mine apart so he could grope my groin. All while in a crowd. I sort of forgot about it until the whole #metoo thing started trending and my point was that I feel weird referring to that as being assaulted.

Some choice responses:

* 'You can't let that define you."" (Uh, it didn't and doesn't?)

* ""You probably learned to not put yourself in that situation again,"" (Standing near a wall in a crowded public space?)

* ""You should hear the stories [his girlfriend] has about when she was a model."" (*Okay?*)

The whole conversation ended with him yelling about how he will never talk to a woman in his office again. I had shared story about an executive making me uncomfortable when he hugged me and kissed my face when we were alone--basically describing the fear a woman might suddenly feel when she realizes she doesn't know who she is with and what they are capable of. "
"> he's probably losing his marbles as he gets older

The issue is, he's *noticeably* losing *his* at quite a progressively speedy rate right in front of our eyes while sitting as the Pres.  Reagan had Nancy to hide Ron's shortcomings.

"[Here‚Äôs an article about his changing stance over his public life](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trumps-evolving-stance-abortion/story?id=38057176). The last segment is what I‚Äôm referring to, it was three stances in three hours not five minutes. My bad."
"Trump gave an interview where Chris Matthews¬†asked - given Trump's previous statement that he ""firmly supported the right to abortion"" - if abortion should be illegal, and if there should be some form of punishment.

Trump said abortion should be illegal, and there should be some form of punishment, including for women getting an abortion, but that men should not be responsible.

This received immense amounts of backlash, including from conservatives who want to make abortion completely illegal and see legal ramifications for women, but would prefer to pretend that none of this constitutes ""punishment"" for women.

Within hours, Trump issued a statement saying that the ""issue is unclear,"" that the states should decide, that he was pro-life, but that there should be exceptions.

And a little bit later in the same day, he issued *another* statement saying that if abortion were to be made illegal - including on the federal level - the doctor performing the abortion should be punished, and that the women getting an abortion ""is a victim in this case.""

"It was joke.

The joke is that normal countries elect women to seats of power all the time. 

The U.S., by contrast, is polluted by a large anti-authoritarian faction. These people count in elections. And these people hate democracy and lust for a authoritarian figure to lead them."
"um, I think the point is that when our primary colleauges in [insert awful thing here] are cultures seen as repressive or backward that the stories the US tells itself about itself are bullshit. 

It's like comparing the maternal death rates, child mortality rates, or paid leave rates between the us and the rest of the world. You can't compare us to western Europe or Japan or Australia or the types of countries that first come to mind as ""equal"" to the us. You have to compare us to countries you wouldn't expect. For example, to think about maternal death rates, you have to compare Texas to subsaharan Africa. "
"Conservatives are just inherently hypocritical. They shriek about Hollywood elites, then elect one. They claim they want someone who is ""like them,"" then support someone like Trump and vilify AOC. The list goes on and on."
"For them it is, and there is absolutely no shame.   That is, truly, who they see as the superior class in every way.  They are JUST smart enough to not completely and totally own that in public, and to hide the belief in public, though."
"He's just the figurehead. The rest of the GOP could vote him out but he takes the heat for doing exactly what they want and what they would do in his place. When he dies, and if the Senate is still GOP controlled, we'll just hate the next one."
"I just have a lot of anxiety around trusting my vote is actually received and counted correctly. If I vote by mail, my ballot could get lost or thrown away. If I vote in person, the machine could be hacked. Even if I vote in person on a paper ballot, it could be tossed. Fuck, do we even have any assurance that the polling people aren't just making up numbers wholecloth?"
"Canada has this. 

Your employer *must* allow you to vote, and must allow you to appear in court. 

> By law, eligible electors must have three consecutive hours to cast their vote on election day. If your hours of work do not allow for three consecutive hours to vote, your employer must give you time off.

> For example, if you live in a riding where voting hours are 9:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. and you usually work from 11:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., your hours of work will not allow three consecutive hours for voting. To give you three consecutive hours to vote, your employer could allow you to arrive late (at 12:30 p.m.), let you leave early (at 6:30 p.m.), or give you three hours off at some point during the work day.

> Your employer has the right to decide when the time off will be given.

"That's the law here too, except for the compensation part. The issue is that the person has to justify they need time off work to their employer (as in, they couldn't go vote another time).


It's really simple to do voting by mail and extended hours. Some local areas in CA are even testing a program that is entirely vote by mail or drop off locations of the ballot you receive in the mail. No polling place, no lines, etc.




You'll always be able to tell locations that are interested in good government and voting by the aim being to make any program or process more accessible.  Other areas have hours long lines, people who show up to vote suddenly get purged from the rolls, and more.

It's also the only way Trump, Trump, Trump (that's actually three separate people) and Kushner don't end up in jail, possibly the eldest for the remainder of his life.

"Sure, you can do that for like...offices and retail stores and restaurants and stuff. They're not essential businesses from a societal standpoint. But that would be impossible for some people - including a lot of health care workers. Can't just understaff the ER, or grandma's nursing home."
"Honestly, no-excuse absentee/early voting solves this entire problem, it's just that a lot of states don't have that. For example, mine. There's a list of reasons you can have for voting early/absentee in VA, but you do actually have to HAVE a reason. You can't just go to the registrar's office and tell them you don't feel like doing it on Election Day and want to vote early instead."
"its greed without regard for the consequences.  its two views on life.  ivanka trump said that people dont want a guaranteed job with a livable wage.  they want a chance for upward mobility.

"Seriously he's a puppet.   Putin has been doing all this shit through him, Trump just lay back, let it happen & collected the money off the dresser.   Trump didn't organise the money to the NRA to keep the USA divided on Gun laws & to try to keep guns in the hands of violent people.   Trump doesn't fund the trolls & bots that keep the incels, Magas & the Donald going.   He sure as hell had no grasp of what Cambridge Analytical was doing.

"No, that‚Äôs a very bad idea. You do not want millions of people going to the polls who‚Äôs only motivation is getting paid. That will result in the winner of the election becoming the person with the most name recognition. Make it easy as you please to vote, absolutely, but don‚Äôt incentivize or worse yet, force people to do it.
"
"There are similar laws in most states. The problem comes when people have other commitments that eat into those three hours (like travel time to/from job and polling place, having to pick up kids from school/day care, long lines at polling places, etc.). Cutting out an entire 8+ hour commitment on Election Day would go a long way toward getting people who are already stretched thin to the polls."
"In Canada, by law, your employer must provide you with three consecutive hours to cast your vote on election day. If your hours of work do not allow for three consecutive hours to vote, your employer must give you time off"
"Well, I guess I see it like this:

For someone who is low income and working, a week off from work with no pay could potentially kill them. It could make their next paycheck awful, keeping them from paying rent, buying food, paying bills, buying gas, etc etc.

A company is never going to give people a free week of pay, nor are most gonna willingly shut down for a day of their choice. (My other idea was each company chooses one day during voting week to close.) This would hurt their profits, and so they would get all pissy about it.

The best choice, imo, is to make voting occur over a week (Monday, Nov 2 to Friday, Nov 6) and giving each employee a forced day off. Allowing employers to choose the day lets them arrange schedules so that they could be open OR choose to send them all off on one day so that they can just be closed and then be fully staffed the rest of the week. Maybe make this have to be determined two weeks in advance so that employees and consult with their other job in case they need to arrange coinciding off days."
I did. I think mail in ballots are worse. You lose complete control over it and should a party decide they don‚Äôt want to lose they ‚Äúcan‚Äôt find‚Äù this mail in ballots. That happens every year it seems. We need voting reform that verifies your vote electronically somehow with an open way for us the citizen to verify the votes for both parties. We take their word for it and we don‚Äôt actually have a way to verify anything. I don‚Äôt think mail in ballots would change anything. How many people have you heard say ‚Äúmy vote doesn‚Äôt count they know who won already anyway‚Äù? I‚Äôve heard that for *years*.

"He is in no way an extremist, nor was he linked to Christchurch aside from someone making a donation in the shooters name. By this logic if a murderer donates to a polician from another country, said politician should be banned from entering the US. "
The Christchurch "Link" in this case is the fact that the NZ shooter donated money to this guys political party last year. There is no evidence to suggest he was involved in or encouraged anything. He has an American fiancee and other significant ties to the U.S. which give him every reason to be here. This is just another government sponsored witch hunt simply because of his political beliefs.
"Good, keep him the hell out. The normalization of extremism shouldn't be facilitated.

If this guy were an Arab that had these same links to Muslim extremism, 9 out of 10 Reddit ""free speech advocates"" wouldn't support him. In fact, Reddit free speech advocates, by large, only seem to support being able to say extremely right wing ideas (if you can call them ideas) without punishment. They virtually never display the same zeal for people of colors' speech rights, or ideological beliefs that could be classified as liberal...which is quite telling."
"If you're a US citizen and also an alt-right asshole, then you're here to stay and your speech is protected.  I'm perfectly fine with that.  But let's not allow outsiders into the country if we know they are a piece of shit.  That also goes for ISIS supporters, cartel members, criminal offenders, etc..  It has nothing to do with race or the country of origin and everything to do with how functional you will be in society."
"Wow what a shitty headline. First of all, the Christchurch guy wasn't far-right extreme... He cheered the death of conservatism IN HIS MANIFESTO. His own words...

He also was basically an environmental advocate to the point of terrorism.

His manifesto is the most anti-right wing thing you could imagine from somebody like this. 

And lastly, he he was denied because he might be soon arrested for fucking murder. "
"> if he‚Äôs cleared of any connection he will be given the permit

My first thought was, he received a donation from someone he doesn't know.  What the heck does that have anything to do with anything?  

But your comment makes it seem more that the donation is being used to justify a deeper investigation, which is very reasonable and justified.  If he's advocating violence, if he's indoctrinating terrorists, if his speech crosses the line of vigorous but polite discourse, we don't want him here.  "

""No one has a right to visit the US, and the executive branch can keep out whoever they want"" is the entire rationale behind Trump's Muslim ban, and his new stupid attempt to close the Mexican border. 

Not allowing this Austrian guy in fits that same logic - i.e., no non-American has the right to enter the US without the federal government's/executive branch's permission. Persons who've been given a green card, visa, etc., have that permission, and those that haven't, don't."
"US Right Wing: ""This is wrong. He shouldn't be banned because of his views just because he shares them with a far right terrorist.""

Also US Right Wing: ""BUILD THE WALL!!! KEEP EM MEXICANS OUT!!!! #MAGA #TRUMP #GODBLESSAMERICA #BUILDTHEWALL #2NDAMENDMNET #JESUS"""

"People happy that freedom of speech is being restricted.

Also the same people didn't actually read the article to find out that the real reason he was banned is because the Christchurch shooter donated to him, and he was banned for ""possible connections"".

Quote from the article itself:  Authorities discovered that the accused Christchurch gunman sent a ‚Ç¨1,500 (\$1,700) donation to Sellner last year.

So the shooter donated to him, and Sellner had his home raided, and his US travel permit revoked as a result.  I wonder if the same people happy about this feel the same when their favorite politicians get donations from Saudi Arabia and Russia?"
"1. It's not a political party, it's a registered association, the ""Identit√§re Bewegung √ñsterreichs"" - ""Identiarian Movement of Austria"". They do not participate in elections, but are a group who engages in right wing political activism, such as public protests, internet trolling, sabotage, creating public disturbances etc.
2. He tried to enter the US with a tourist visa in order to get married to his fiancee. AFAIK that is not allowed under US law (think of ""green-card marriages""), though I'm not 100% sure about that.
3. You're not wrong about it being a government sponsored affair, however it is the Austrian government. The ""witch hunt"" is originating here from the ultra-nationalist Austrian government party FP√ñ and its leaders, who occupy the vice-chancellery and the ministry of the interior, and who are afraid of the competition  on the right wing."
Yeah seems like everyone is an alt righter now. They are calling conservatives alt righters now like Ben Shapiro. Seems like a deplatforming technique. The definition of alt right sure as hell changed.
"Eh, this guy is legit crazy and super far right wing fascist. As much as I dislike the American Republican Party they‚Äôre not quite as extreme as this guy. I would also hardly consider Austria to be nearly as progressive as any Western Europe country."

We deny Islamist Terrorists because of their destructive political views which advocate for the destruction of the Great Satan. I am more than happy we applied this same scrutiny to another group of harmful extremists--those who target non-white or non-christian groups.
"By this logic every single ideology is extremist in some way or another, weird how this logic only applies to white people and those are the right. People on the left demonizing those on the right and literally encouraging violence with things like ‚Äúpunch a nazi‚Äù and then labeling everyone as a nazi doesn‚Äôt fit this definition though. Some guy talking about taking in less immigrants and having it be okay to have a white identity is encouraging terrorist though. Give me a break."
"I'm not sure what constitutes which in your opinion, so I'll post this and let you decide.

Austrian Identitarian Movement leader Martin Sellner is the man highlighted in the article.

> The Identitarian movement or Identitarianism is a European and North American far-right and white nationalist movement that originated in France. The identitarians began as a youth movement, with their name derived from the French Nouvelle Droite (New Right) G√©n√©ration Identitaire (Generation Identity)

>According to Christoph Gurk of Bayerischer Rundfunk, one of the goals of identitarianism is to make racism modern and fashionable. Austrian identitarians invited radical right-wing groups from across Europe, including several neo-Nazis groups, to participate in an anti-immigration march, according to Anna Thalhammer of Die Presse."
"The use of the word ""socialist"" in National Socialist was purposeful and had nothing to do with socialism as you think it to be.  When the Nazi Party was established in the 1920s, the leadership felt the use of the word would be attractive to working class people who were growing disaffected by an economy that was swinging overwhelmingly to the very wealthy.

The tenets of National Socialism attached themselves to Moussilini's fascist movement from the start (Moussilini was first) and was a decidedly right wing party that emphasized the individual over the collective by uniting people through nationalism and racism.  The ""other"" was a very important tool to the Nazi movement.  Like Italy, Germany embraced the corporatist approach in pumping government money into the corporate class then paying the classes deemed pure (Germanic peoples) and enslaving the ""others"" (Jews, gypsies, etc.).

Social programs were for the racially pure and it only came through nationalistic allegience.  Hardly socialist in the sense you are trying to insinuate."

Exactly. People like this are the reason why you need to pass immigration before entering a country. Extremists and other sketchy people regardless of their beliefs or politics are exactly the kind of people that are to be identified and denied entry. Literally no one is supporting this dude. People are dense.
"The actual US Right wing: ‚ÄúWe must protect our countries people and make sure to screen and identify any people who desire to enter the country.‚Äù This man is dangerous. He is fucking associated with a terrorist and hate groups. How fucking dense must you be not to realize that we dont want militant extremists of any belief to have access to our country. Yes, its that simple."
"You know, you‚Äôre going to have to justify this claim. What makes the far left worse than literal Nazis? Like worse than people who actively believe in racial hierarchy, that Jews are trying to destroy the West, that gay people are an abomination, etc."
"That's not what the facts say at all about this issue. There are dozens of different published reports from academia and law enforcement on this topic. 

The far left will stir shit up and pull fire alarms when their shitty safe spaces aren't kept sacrosanct but they are not blowing up government buildings like Tim McVeigh or shooting up churches and synagogues like.... Too many right wing nuts to count at this point.


If you have been indoctrinated that the far left is worse than the far right, you should escape from your current situation and look into the facts more deeply."
"Its dangerous when journalists can easily label anyone who doesn't identify with far left authoritarians as Alt-Right.  

-you don't want to ban guns, you're Alt Right

-you have objections about what they teach kids in elementary school?  yep you're Alt-Right

It's easier to just throw this crap at people they disagree with instead of having a discussion.  Which is dangerous since the last time identity politics was rampant  ended up bringing a fringe but extremely vocal socialist group into power which lead to one of the most horrific case of genocide in modern history and plunge the world into WW2."
Christ. I lean left of center. The only really strong political opinion I have is that I support guns/gun ownership. That suddenly makes me "too far right" for some people because they don't care to know anything else about me when they find out I like guns

"Sweeping them all under the rug doesn‚Äôt help either as they will just end up in a space together and radicalize each other, whereas giving them a megaphone to spout their bullshit makes it easier for people to call them out and maybe even convince them to abandon those ideas."
"They called for direct violence against others? 

While I detest what they think without a Direct call for violence I would respect the right for them to hold them. I also think Intersectionality sucks but am find with those people under the same Guidelines. 

Words in and of themselves aren't violence, Direct calls to actions are.  "
"Not the poster but alot of people get labeled that and have to deal with backlash. Even individuals on the left like Joe Rogan, tim pool, I forget the name but some British you tuber, not on the left but Jordan Peterson have all been labeled Alt right by media.

Fuck the guy in this article but we can't pretend it doesn't happen as a way to smear people "
"Is that why the GOP pushes for policies of rounding up families that have been living in the US for decades, sometimes generations and separate them into camps? Regardless that the target demographic of that operation performs less violent crimes on average than US citizens? Is that also why when you sort by new in this comment section you can see its full of people calling this a liberal conspiracy and political move? How dense do you have to be to not see that, even if simply ensuring immigrants are safe is your goal, that its very obviously not the real goal of mainstream US conservatives?"
"No, back it up even a step further.  Before justifying this claim, we need to establish what exactly the far left even *is*.  The far right is a well established, pseudo-organized movement at this point.  The ""far left"" is a boogeyman people piss and moan about despite the fact that they have no measurable effect on the world, to the point where the very existence of such a movement is questionable.

I say this as someone who leans right of center.  Let's see some evidence that the ""far left"" is even a thing outside of a few communist nutjobs."
That‚Äôs not accurate at all. The authoritarian left slanders and silences anyone less progressive than Chomsky. They are far more dangerous as they are embraced by more moderate leftists while at least the majority of those on the right shun those on the extreme fringe.
"Oh... so I guess Venezuela was taken over by radical leftists, completely supported by western leftist academics and then go on and completely and utterly destroy the country. Leading to the death of thousands. I guess that never happened. "
"Oh, do you have proof of him being a Nazi?  You should prove it so you can actually dismiss any points I made.  That way you can make my claim seem like bullshit, instead of contributing nothing of value.

"If someone addle-brained enough to be influenced without realizing it is lead on the train of thought that violence towards a certain group or individual is ok or even good. Then the person responsible for influencing that individual should also be held accountable.

It make sense, history have shown us demagogues have their fair share of violence that they crusaded on."
"If the Christchurch shooter found himself mildly disgruntled with Muslims, but had no sympathetic ear to discuss it or vent about it, he would have kept that disgruntlement to himself, and it would have had a greater chance of just fizzling out on its own.

People like Martin Sellner and Richard Spencer might not be pulling any triggers themselves, but they're knowingly providing a sympathetic ear to people expressing those bigoted ideas in the hopes of cultivating the exact type of seething hatred that motivates people to do their dirty work for them. "
"It means if you don't believe like OP, you need to be sent to a re-education camp until you do believe.

These people are batshit crazy.  

I don't believe in hurting people, but I also don't believe thoughts and words and books directly lead to violence.  It's much more complex than that.  If it isn't, let's start banning video games that let you hurt people.  "
"They're literally saying that he's guilty of a thought crime. This shit has officially gone *too far*. Not only his he guilty of a thought crime, but so is anyone qwho has ever tolerated someone saying something racist near them. 

"
"He hasn't been charged with a crime, and talking isn't thinking.  For a country that super's strict on who they let in, why should this guy be let in?  If he had been tied to islamic extremists he'd get the same treatment."
"The same crowd that goes after Muslims, communists in the 50's, blames so much on ""socialists"", ""Antifa"", BLM and everything that isn't them, has no problem with literally leaving asylum seekers in large barbed pens under bridges, or having despots hitting our own citizens, or having foreign powers mess with our elections, or having our own candidates mess with their own elections, and you wanna talk about how *they're* persecuted for ""thought crimes""? Hilarious. "
"Not only that, but this guy has extremely clearly repudiated the Christchurch shooter, and has been a very vociferous opponent of violent actions or means. Has anyone here even seen his videos, especially those after the Christchurch attack where he names Tarrant, Breivik and whoever else chooses to resort to violence as some of the biggest enemies of the peaceful political movement that he is trying to promote. Even if you strongly believe that people have social responsibility for their speech and that they should be held closely accountable for it under the strictest of scrutiny - Sellner has more than fulfilled such responsibility.

This move will only empower those who, unlike Sellner and in the strongest opposition to his views, think that violence is the only resort they have left."
"Those goddamn self-hating whites. They're clearly brainwashed into thinking that people of every creed deserve respect and it's only extremists that are a problem!

I met a brown guy today who was an asshole!! And he had an accent! (the previous 2 sentences were true, the following is /s) How long until we're overrun with brown assholes? What, those brown/black/whatever folks who are just living their life? Yeah well fuck them they might be assholes!! "
"What about the Charolettesville? Was that just a ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù gathering of the right? Or was there literal video evidence of people saying ‚Äúthe Jews will not replace us‚Äù and to ‚Äúgas them‚Äù all while wearing Nazi memorabilia and waving Nazi flags? Those are direct calls to snuff people out no matter how much you wanna sugar coat it. If someone told you you men were inferior and that ‚Äúx‚Äù person was a hero for sending you back ‚Äúwhere you came from‚Äù or ‚Äúgassing you‚Äù you‚Äôd probably feel threatened and be brigading reddit posts who advocate for that kind of extremism, like you‚Äôre doing now.

The right wing is full of Nazis and Nazi sympathizers and both have no place in a civilized modern society 

"
"Are you fine with people promoting opinions that radicalise other individuals like the Christchurch shooter into terrorist actions?

Here in the UK we had a number of Islamic hate preachers who the public clamoured to get deported because they incited extremism. And rightly so. But when it‚Äôs the white far right suddenly the same outraged individuals start wringing their hands and talking about free speech. What‚Äôs with the double standards?"
">He is not even a white supremacist.

He¬¥s got a sideline producing propaganda for a white nationalist movement and hangs out with notables of our nazi party during saturday nights. I think that¬¥s reason enough to get profiled."
I said as of late. I'm talking about a number of the shooters over the past few years or so. The only shooter from the left I can immediately think of is that person who made an attack on that Conservative baseball game. 
"All those places have what in common? authoritarian ultranationalism, characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and of the economy.....


Those are very right wing characteristics. Literally the definition of fascism.

You've been misled on this it appears.... And you're now repeating those mistakes."

"We already have dozens of restrictions on free speech, I wouldn‚Äôt mind another restriction of fascist speech. It‚Äôs non essential and isn‚Äôt part of genuine public discourse cause it leads to murder: 

Speech not protected by the first amendment or minimally or intermediately protected :

Fighting words, child pornography, obscenity, profanity on public airwaves, commercial speech, conduct not related to expression, incitement, threats, libel, slander, defamation, speech on designated public forums and limited public forums. And the government can regulate the time place and manner of your protests on public forums

I fail to see how advocating for a white nationalisms is that essential and for me it ought to be chucked into the following list. 

I did a video on hate speech not that you care but I did it for informational purposes so. 

https://youtu.be/5-U9RQatFfM"
"Encouraging others to do harm to a certain person but refusing to do it yourself, while incentivising whoever is listening, to do it not ""for"" you, but for you. 

This should be punishable to an extent, but precautions would be needed to not link people with unrelated things even though someone's trying their hardest to make it pass as related. "
"Negativo good buddy. It stops being a thought when you write it down and publish it on the internet. No one believes we should be able to control what goes on in your head as the only person affected by those thoughts is you. Once you write that shit down and publish it for the world to see it stops being a thought and starts being a communication which is punishable by law.

You wanna fight back against the ""thought police""? Stop publishing your terroristic thoughts on the internet."
"Yea the real victims are the poor fascists not the 200 million victims of nationalism and fascism plus Christchurch, Charleston, the synagogue. Etc over the past 100 years.

In fact every murder in 2019 by a terrorist was by right wing terrorists in the us.

But you wanna complain about the poor fascists who got denied a visa? Your priorities are backwards son.

We‚Äôve seen what happens when we let this stuff take over a nation its called ww2 and ww1 and it‚Äôs worst excess. "
"To the deleted reply:

I don't have a thesaurus, I actually just am plain pretentious, so I'm glad you think my writing is true to my nature. Not that this is at all relevant to the discussion at hand."
"Yes, because absolutely limiting their freedom makes them less insane in any way. In fact, the chance that one of those morons is going to commit a mass shooting only becomes bigger the more you infringe on his right to free speech. What do you honestly think will happen when one of these guys gets their free speech taken away, nobody bothers to listen to them and they see no other way out?"
"No it‚Äôs not you absolute authoritarian. If you engage in dialogue with them you can convince them that their ideas are shit and yours are better. If you‚Äôre confident in your own beliefs, you don‚Äôt need to silence anyone."
"Alt-right is an alternative right. They're the ones who have white supremacist and nationalist views, dangerous ""solutions"" and violent demonstrations. 

Far right is still mainstream right, just further out with stronger, less forgiving beliefs. To me, a far right person may support a shop not serving a person of color because the shop should have individual freedom and a free market will correct his actions. An alt-right will support the same shop because they don't believe the person of color should have the same rights. End result is the same, but their logics wouldn't apply the same to other scenarios, say a shop owned by a POC refusing service to a white male. Far-right position would remain the same, far-white would flip sides on the argument. "
" in my opinion i think its just semantics , though everything these days seems to have a crazy breakdown, at which point that breakdown is defined by the outlet or individuals beliefs .  i would say that far right is people who are extreme conservatives  but not necessarily villainous, like that idiot sitting in congress who claimed in a rape case that the female body has a way of ""shutting that thing down so it wasnt rape""

&#x200B;

I think alt right covers those dangerous people who are trying to spread a dangerous and violent ideology, or superiority/race purity shit. the type of people who marched in Charleston or claim all this these terrible things about muslims  or jewish people. shits crazy these days idk. thats pretty much how i interpret it "
"I find it especially hilarious that if my European-ancestry genes wind up mixing with someone who doesn't share my European ancestry, it's used as evidence of some kind of grand conspiracy to destroy whiteness when the reality is that it spreads European genes around.

People be dumb."
"Because look at china. They are the largest etho natonal country and they seem to be doing well. My issue isn‚Äôt diversity, it is when one group wants to overtake the other. Just make your own country better, no need to make it worse for people who have it good."
"No, it's not. None of what you said is accurate.  
An identitarian is just someone who subscribes to identity politics.  
Identity politics is all the rage these days, so why is it bad when it's white identity politics?  
Further, identitarians don't advocate for ethno-states. Those are ethno-nationalists.  
"
"We're not talking about the history of the last century, we're discussing ongoing sociopolitical movements.  Not every act of terrorism is committed by the ""far left"" or ""far right"".  Just because there are left wing terrorists in our nation's history does not mean that there is an active ""far left"" movement of active extremists going on in our country right now.  The wikipedia article you linked doesn't support your assertion one bit, but if you'd spent more than 5 seconds on it you'd know that."
"I mean, you can probably find some tankie that says those things. Crazies exists everywhere. But we as the far left actively try to keep those kinda people away from any position of power because we are very concerned about power structures and hierarchies (Kinda comes with the territory of being far left). 

Meanwhile the far right will happily nod along with their neonazi segment and elect them into office...

It's not about the individual crazies. Its about how the rest of the movement deals with them."
I hate the far right for obvious reasons and I hate the far left for reasons any normal (sane) person would know anyway. It doesn't help that Antifa exists. They're as much of an extremist group as white supremacists and quite frankly should be put under surveillance.
"No need for specific instructions either. I mean Duterte didn't give specific instructions. He just enabled people who believed they had the right to end other people's lives.

Just having someone in a position of power displaying support for violent ideologies make people who believe them think that violence is OK. 

Other example include, in random order

""Maybe 2nd amendment people could do something about...""


""No, I don't know that Atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots.""

""Basket of deplorables"" 

""the walloons do not have the intellectual ability to learn dutch"".

This is why negationists do not get a tribune in Europe, because it enables people who listen to figures of authority to think it is OK to behave or openly claim this.

It is also why the ""grab 'em by the"" incident is very grave because it was downplayed and certainly led people to believe this kind of talk or behavior is acceptable in masculinity. "
"We're talking about an American action there bucko, everything you wrote is 100% bunk.  And as the pro-illegal-alien folks will so often remind us, the Constitution's rights apply to non-citizens so yeah, you're speaking bunk."
You throw the word fascist around like you would know what it means. But calling Zellner a fascist is beyond stupid. He is an identiterian and nationalist but far far away from fascist. Damn American stop using the word fascist for everything rightwing. 
"I might agree with your argument if we didn‚Äôt have 100 years of European counter revolutionary activity that points to the contrary. The only way to stop fascists is to stop their ability to comfortably organize and be comfortable in public spaces spreading their vitriol. 

How do you explain the intrawar years where liberal republicans were over run by fascists merely because they had unlimited freedom to spew shit into an economically chaotic time period. "
"I am confident in my beliefs. But the marketplace of ideas is a hopeful idea. It's assuming people work in good faith and are willing to listen.

Reality does not work this way, as we've seen time and time again."
"They don't want to be convinced though. It doesn't matter how good your arguments are if they put their fingers in their ears and yell ""LALALALALA!!!""

Anything true you say to them is a conspiracy...

First rule of any cult is don't engage with anyone outside: they're (sometimes literally) the devil."
"It's really not that complicated. 

>Have recent ties to a terrorist that killed 50 people

You get put on the list.

If it's found out you have nothing to do with them or hold any similar views then you're let in. "
"No they arent even in the same scale at all. Compare the bodycount and tell me antifa is ""as much of an extremist group"". Recently a white supremacist in christchurch killed 50 people more in one day than antifa combined since its inception. I know the antifa really hurts your feelings when they talk about ending fascists and all, but thats not as bad as gunning muslims down, or running people over."
"> It doesn't help that Antifa exists

Do they? A couple friends tie a bandana around theyre face and say ""im an antifa!"" and smash a few windows, throw rocks, or bust a few lips. Not a drop of organization, not a word of meaningful communication outside that group of friends. No, its a couple common teen/early 20s thugs trying to be edgy and cool with theyre friends. Antifas nothing more than a boogyman.


Not to mention youre comparing a few broken windows and a bloody lip to a regular stream of mass shootings and bombings. Thats one hell of a fucked world view."
"I‚Äôll assume you‚Äôre talking about interwar Germany, where liberalism and democracy were hardly common values. Many Germans wanted a restoration of the monarchy or something in that regard, giving them incentive to vote for many right-wing parties such as V√∂lkisch Block or the NSDAP.  Nowadays we have safeguards against these sorts of things because open violence gets suppressed by the police since it‚Äôs illegal. Hell, in my country you cannot enter politics if you reject the idea of democracy because, strange as it may seem, we actually learned how to avoid these sorts of things in the future by adjusting our legislation."
"Oh. Yeah, its possible but incredibly rare. It's just insane to me that so many people are willing to subvert the 1st amendment to ban bad speech rather than using their own freedom of speech to fight back against bad speech. I will always think of banning speech as the greater of two evils because it's such a short-sighted idea. I'm not totally sure where I stand on banning people from the country based on their political views, but the freedom of speech is sacred. Just thought I would add my two cents."
"Diversity doesn‚Äôt make anything, anything. I would argue tribalism divides people, what we need is unity. This goes back to the old trope of ‚ÄúThere are no hyphenated Americans, there are only Americans.‚Äù"
"If they are advocating violence to others by all means but If you simply dislike their opinion while they are staying within the realm of legal speech then you shouldn't be able to take that away from them.

Just as it shouldn't be taken away from you.   "
"Oh, I haven't heard of this group ""eco fascist white supremacist fucks"". I can't find it in any Google searches either. Surely you'd think an international terrorist group would have some sort of internet presence, right? Weird that they don't.

You're now accusing this guy of murdering children? Are you just insane or what? "
"What makes them ""extreme right wing""? They haven't carried out a single attack nor broken a single law. Also, he isn't responsible for donations he receives, it's literally out of his control who clicks the donate button. He's being banned because of something someone else did which he had absolutely no control over, it's absolutely ridiculous."
"Only an absolute moron would assume that I'd even try to defend the far right. Antifa has a noble goal but their means are fucking bonkers. Throwing bricks onto a demonstration from a rooftop is what you think is normal?

You guys have to start learning a very simple thing: The world isn't black and white. Just because Antifa is an extremist group based on their means doesn‚Äôt mean that their goal is bad. Just because the far right sometimes manages to pull off a peaceful demo doesn‚Äôt mean their ideology is even remotely ok.
"
"Can I bring the USSR into this? North Korea? Venezuela? Other left wing hellscapes? The shooters as evil as they are, 500 people over decades? North Korea can do that in a weekend. Venezuela destroyed countless lives. I couldn‚Äôt give you an accurate number of deaths it‚Äôs security apparatuses are responsible for. But surely it‚Äôs higher then 500."
"we have those limits already ... no inciting violence( I want you to go kill ____ )  ...no creating a public panic ( yelling fire in a movie theater ), what's going on in this case is they are absolutely trying to limit free speech and I'm seeing a whole lot of morons applauding this and calling the other side fascists . I've never even heard of this guy ...but because of what's happening with all these geniuses trying to shut him up I'm definitely interested in what he's  saying. So now I gotta find out for myself what he's about so I can make my own decision  ...you guys see how that works ?"
"Yeah I remember how he converted them in the middle of rallies and lynchings /s. There are times and places where people are susceptable to having their minds changed, if it were as easy as just talking to them then there would be no racists left. While we wait for the right time, we still have to do something to prevent further terroristic acts, the spreading of their ideology, and the emboldening of people who think like they do."
"I‚Äôm talking about early republican Europe after the fall of the monarchies and the rise of post war republics not just Germany. Fascism thrived in most of Western Europe. 

Yes, but the Weimar Republic had robust freedom of speech protections before the emergency invocations and the economic chaos mixed with the ability of fascists to openly organize and beat people. 

Here‚Äôs a quote*
Why Did Democracy Fail?

When the Weimar Republic was formed in 1919, there were hopeful signs that democracy would take root in Germany. The new democratic constitution with its expanded bill of rights was one of the most progressive in the world. Many Germans belonged to the well-educated middle class made up of business owners, government workers, and professionals who normally flourish in a democracy. Political parties freely competed in elections. But democracy still failed in Germany. Why?

Some historians blame the failure of democracy on individuals. The moderate chancellors were ineffective leaders who constantly rose and fell as party coalitions gained or lost strength in the Reichstag. President Hindenburg doubted democracy and dreamed of restoring the kaiser to power. Extremists like Hitler hated democracy."
"> I‚Äôm not far right‚ÄîI just enjoy standing up and defending the murderous assholes...

This isn‚Äôt a free speech issue, or even a media mislabeling issue. 

It‚Äôs a hate issue, where violent extremists think it‚Äôs OK to shoot up random people just because of a difference in skin color or religion or sexuality. 

So piss off with your enabling ‚Äúthose guys really aren‚Äôt *that* bad‚Äù bullshit..."
"Nobody is being persecuted for having certain views. Literally no far right person has gone to jail for holding these views. 
People counter protesting far right racism doesn't mean your right to free speech is being taken away. In fact it means they are exercising their freedom of expression. All these alt right idiots complaining about free speech issues have no idea what free speech means."
"I have no need to entertain illegitimate opinions.  For instance, I do not need to debate if the Earth is spherical; it simply is so.  I don‚Äôt need to hear if germ theory is real or not; it is.  Racial superiority is another example of illegitimate thought.  There is nothing more to be meaningfully gained  by its advancement in honest debate.  It is as flawed a premise as trying to say human slavery should be legal.  Some ideas deserve no oxygen.  Fascism is a discredited political ideology.  Mussolini, Hitler, and Franco kinda ruined it for everyone else.  As people, I think we are free to debate the ideas that still haven‚Äôt proven to be demonstrably false.  "
what does USSR north korea and venezuela has to do with christchurch shootings or antifa? Also what intel you have on north korea that they kill 500 people in a weekend ? I'd love to see your sources on that north korean massacre.
"I mean the US incarcerates far and away more people relative to our population size than north Korea.

I watched a video today of a guy being shot 25 times by 6 police officers for falling asleep in his car while black (Willie Bo if anyone's curious)

Now I'm not saying by any means that this excuses the other ""left-wing hellscapes"" as you call them. But we're not doing so great ourselves."
"I've said people have the right to believe what they will until they take action or promote direct action against others. 

Hate is bad, but people have a right to hate others as i'm sure you hate me... But as long as we are capable of living together while holding those that break those tenets responsible for their actions you have a right to do what you please. 

This guy looks like a load of shit but as long as he isn't harming others by his own action or calling for the direct violent actions by others, he gets to go on being a load of shit. "
"You also don't have the right to deprive anyone of those opinion if they want to hold them... They don't get to take things away form you and you don't from them. 

Both Communism and Fascism have been proven wrong, which is why I'm glad at-least I live in a Liberal democracy. "
"The executive has become increasingly powerful since the Civil War, but Congress continues to give away their Constitutional power, largely so they can avoid being held responsible for their own decisions."
"The US executive is wildly to powerful, but not even by design. Congress continues to surrender more and more power.

What I think really needs a revamp is the legislative, the Senate should have the ability to override the House, but it should be seen as extraordinary, not a daily occurrence, and the Speaker of the House should fill much of the role the President does now, similar to a Prime Minister."
I see a lot of conversation about the power of the executive branch but almost none about the power of the Supreme Court. There is essentially zero check to the power of the Supreme Court. As more and more legislative issues are solved in the court system the more power is granted to unelected officials. Its insane to me and I dont know what to do about it
"The problems you listed are mainly because Congress refuses to do it's job.  Having congress create legislation and laws will fix the with the supreme court.  If we create laws around abortion, climate change, etc, we would not longer leave it up to the supreme court to decide these issues based on their interpretation of the Constitution.  The executive branch has a ridiculous amount of power, given to it by Congress.  All the executive orders which have gotten insane.  The power of the FCC/FTC/EPA/etc, which should really have over sight by Congress and not the executive branch, but Congressional leaders would rather let the executive branch create laws so they never have to answer to their constituents why they added laws they don't agree with.   This is not a Trump issue, its just both parties are happy to give their guy executive powers, and call it a dictator when the other parties guy uses the power given to them.  

As for the Mueller report, if it is released with 90% of it redacted, Congress can sue to get it released, that is the Separation of power in action."
"Yes, but actually doing it is a horrible idea, as that would require an unregulated constitutional convention with no legal guidance from the constitution itself where each participant had godlike power over the US government and its institutions."
"The Senate should absolutely not be allowed to override the House. As it is, the electoral college gives a handful of states huge sway over the presidency, and the Senate gives rural states an advantage. As someone who lives in a non-rural, non-swing state, taking power away from the House would be a deal breaker for me.

edit: formating"
"SCOTUS Nominations - The SCOTUS serve for life or until they retire. They could be completely brain-dead, forced to live with machines, and incapable of controlling their own bowel movements, but still have the job as the highest judges in the land. This is balanced by the fact that they have to be nominated by the POTUS and then approved by the Senate (""advice and consent of the Senate""). You gotta clear one branch and half of the other branch to get the job.

Federal Judges are identical to the SCOTUS, just with less media involvement.

POTUS - You have be selected by your party (not an official requirement, just an effect of how our voting system works) and win the electoral vote.

Electoral College - While some think it is either archaic or distorted, it provides numerous advantages over a simple popular vote. First is that it forces the POTUS-to-be to actually care about places other than large population centers. Second, is that Electors are human, and can vote for someone else if the candidate dies or is incapacitated. Third, the States are given the power to chose their electors. The whole ""winner takes all"" is not part of the Constitution, but an artifice of the States, whom the parties rely on to avoid having to spend resources campaigning in 60/40 States.

Senate - Senators used to be determined by the States, as they saw fit. It was changed to popular vote via the 17th Amendment in 1913. The Senate represents the States, not the people, as such, each State is considered an equal. The existence of a bicameral Congress is a compromise between popular representation and equality of States. The VP runs the Senate and is chosen by the Senate when the Electoral College does not have a majority. Treaties, appointments, and removal of the POTUS (after Impeachment) come from here or are ratified here.

House of Representatives - Representatives represent the people, supposedly. Gerrymandering in larger states (CA, IL, TX) has led to Representatives choosing their voters, not the other way around. Because they are based on population, but also limited to 435 (there is only so much room in the Capitol Building), larger States tend to have more people for each Representative, as smaller States are still guaranteed 1 Rep.. All spending must come from here. All POTUS Impeachment and Election (when the Electoral College does not deliver a majority) comes from here.

The checks and balances are from the inherently adversarial relationship and power-grabbing that each branch wants. "
"Congress has ceded much of it's power to both the executive branch and judicial branch as a trade-off for staying un-hated and popular and to continue to be re-elected. A convention of states is what's needed to pass term limits on congressmen, that would be a good start to drain the swamp."
"The legislature approves or disapproves of the Supreme Court pick. They can also change it with legislation, and I am pretty sure they can impeach members of the Supreme Court. The President has very little control over the Supreme Court besides nominations. 

&#x200B;

The Mueller report - I mean, it should be released. But if it's not, it's not the end of the world. "
"Nah. We're fine. 

We've dealt with worse. Much, much worse.

I'm not super interested in making reactionary changes to a system that has worked, more or less, for over a century and a half. As much as I dislike Trump, he's still mostly operating within the confines of his official capacity and has not come even close to provoking any sort of constitutional crisis.  He's defying norms left and right and I think that's a horribly, horribly bad thing (although I'll admit he's throwing out some norms I hate), but norms aren't the constitution. 

I wouldn't mind a few snipping around the edges for reform--independent counsels coming from the SC, for example, and I wouldn't be too sad if we had a mandatory retirement age for the SC--but these aren't major changes. "
"The US is actually the exception to the rule. Presidential systems are actually the least stable forms of government, because what ends up happening is the executive eventually consolidates power and becomes a dictator. I'd rather see the US become a parliamentary system. One, there's quicker ways to take the head of state out of power via a vote of no confidence and if there is grid lock, the prime minister can call snap elections. "
"Nope. The separation of powers within the Constitution and which the founding fathers envisioned are not being exhibited today. Congress has delegated most of its powers to the President and the Supreme Court has become the battleground for policy issues rather than legal arguments. The founding fathers wanted the Senate to be the center of political ingenuity within American political life but ever since the time when LBJ was Majority leader it‚Äôs been dysfunctional. If u want the real reason why people feel like the American political system doesn‚Äôt work is because the system the founding fathers built was on the idea that the representatives, senators, and even presidents were not bound by political affiliation. Today Mitch McConnell can simply not put a schedule a vote on a bill or a measure because he wants too but the founding father never envisioned that the Majority leader would simply block the Senate or Senators from following their constitutional duty because he has a higher love for party and president than country. While Speakers of the House will not put a vote or bill on the floor Cus they don‚Äôt have majority support from within their own party when Congress is supposed to represent ALL the people not simply the people who voted for the party in power. And the bigger issue is that some ppl want to revamp the system so it can ‚Äúwork better‚Äù like when the Senate got rid of judicial filibusters. Only to find out that taking something which seemed like it created political gridlock (Hamilton acc supported gridlock within government to ensure that tyranny would not run riot) meant that you created a lob sided playing field in the Senate.

So the short answer is NOPE Cus just cus government isn‚Äôt working now Cus u got representatives up there who haven‚Äôt read the constitution and care more about party than country doesn‚Äôt mean the whole system is broken."
"A lot of these comments seem predicated on the idea that the Executive is too powerful, and that at least some of that power should be ‚Äúreturned‚Äù to Congress. I‚Äôd question that for two reasons. 

1) it‚Äôs not immediately clear to me that the executive is indeed all powerful. Trump has tried, repeatedly, to implement new policies that, at least on their surface, appear to be explicitly authorized by law or by the Constitution. And yet, he‚Äôs *constantly* hamstrung by the Courts (the 9th Circuit, if we‚Äôre naming names) with their ‚Äúnationwide injunctions‚Äù.  The ultimate adjudicator of these conflicts is the Supreme Court, and the one who leads it is the Chief Justice. This man is the closest thing to a King we‚Äôll get in this iteration of government in the West. *That‚Äôs* where folks should be leveraging their criticism, if their problem is with where ultimate authority resides and their meta problem is that it *doesn‚Äôt* reside with ‚Äúthe people‚Äù.  

2) Does anyone here *actually* want this power returned to Congress? Congress is the most dysfunctional, politically compromised, disgusting part of this style of government. Is everyone really that respectful of the ‚Äúwisdom of the crowd‚Äù that they want these people, who can‚Äôt agree on essentially anything ever, making *more* decisions over how we govern ourselves? "
"Revamp the entire system.

1) Eliminate the office of the President as Head of State and Government.  Replace the President with a 5-person executive council, similar to the Swiss Federal Council.  One member is elected by the House of Representatives and one by the Senate.  The remaining three members are elected via national popular vote for six-year terms with one election every two years and a maximum of two terms per individual.  The Head of State, a purely figurehead position, is the most senior directly elected member.  The function of Head of Government is executed collectively.  The Council has no legislative role -- no power to veto or otherwise formally propose or delay legislation.

2) Double the size of the House of Representatives.  The first half is elected via FPTP districts, the remaining is filled by party list proportional representation, similar to Germany's Bundestag.  This ensures that control of the House is dictated by full popular vote and redistricting has no impact to the balance of power.  Election cycles are every 4 years, not every 2 years.

3) . Eliminate direct election of Senators and allow state legislatures to appoint Senators.  Senators will function effectively as ambassadors of the individual State governments and have no fixed terms and serve at the pleasure of those legislatures.  The powers of the Senate would be substantially reduced.  They may only review and amend bills submitted to them by the House, with the House being able to override any veto by the Senate by a majority vote (allowing the Senate a limited delaying power).  The power of advice and consent for appointments is obviated.  The only substantive power would be the ability to elect an executive councilor.  It would retain its full oversight role, including the power of subpoena, allowing the State governments to have a role in keeping the federal government accountable.  Similar to the UK's House of Lords.

4) . Lifetime appointments to the Supreme Court and all federal courts are eliminated.  The size and composition of each court would be fixed such that one appointment to each court would be made every 1 or 2 years depending on the size of the court.  In the event of a death or resignation, the seat would remain vacant until its regularly scheduled appointment, eliminating strategic resignations or shifts in power due to death.

5)  All spending bills carry with it the implicit authority to issue debt if appropriations are insufficient to cover the bill.

6)  In the event of a failure to pass a spending bill, the House of Representatives is immediately discharged and new elections scheduled.  The Council maintains the government in a caretaker role and appropriations are carried over from present levels."
"I'm beginning to wonder more and more why the Department of Justice is in the Executive branch and not the Judicial. I think moving the department to under the Judicial branch minimizes undue influence from the Executive by taking them out of the chain of command. Officials can still be nominated by the President and approved by the Senate, but would then report to an Official like the Chief Justice. This would make it similar to how FISA courts are operated, other than the fact that FISA judges are appointed by the Chief Justice."
"The US is suffering from too much power being.in the hands of voters. Here me out before you down vote.

Congress has made the executive more and more powerful.by giving away power to the executive via agencies. Think the FAA,FCC,EPA,HUD etc. These agencies have rule making authority, which basically is pseudo legislating as long as the rules are within the scope of the agency.

Short of either a constitutional amendment, or a serious reversal of precedent on the supreme Court, neither of which are likely, this will remain legal.

If we operate under the assumption that this practice will be allowed we need to ask ourselves why. Why is congress giving away power to the executive?

Our entire system is based on the idea that congress and the executive will greedily hold on to power, because we assume most people who want power was to keep/get more of it. Congress isn't acting like this though, and I don't think they all became amazing perfect people overnight. There are still plenty of power hungry people in congress.

So why is congress giving away power? 3 major reasons.

1) the scope of the federal government massively expanded during/after FDR, to the point where if the government actually stopped functioning for a decent amount of time bad shit will happen (see government shutdowns in the past)

2) congress knows that in order to prevent the government from becoming non functional basic rules, regulations etc need to happen regularly. I'm not talking revamping healthcare, I'm talking determining the amount of common chemical X is safe in water, and stuff like that, not Earth shattering newsworthy stuff.

3) the country has become so geographically polarized that taking a stand on anything makes 40-60% of the population mad. So congress created federal agencies as cutouts to take all of the stands, so congress can avoid voting. After all if your goal as a congressman is to keep your job then the best thing you can do is not take stands on issues unless it is widely supported by whatever groups matter to your job security.

How can we fix this?

Either we shrink the federal government to pre FDR levels (good luck), or we make it easier for congressmen to piss off voters while keeping their jobs. Hence reducing the power of voters. "
"> Are these two issues (and any others which you'd like to reference) indicative of a Separation of Powers working exactly as it is intended to work, or are they indicative of a Separation of Powers which needs some redesigning in order to make it work as intended? 

I think they're indicative of the Separation of Powers being broken (IMO, by the 17th Amendment).

If you review your Checks & Balances, you'll find that almost all of the checks on Federal Power were held by the Senate.  If you further look at the original election of the Senators, you would find that the Senators owed their positions to the State Governments.

How do you think a Senate that owed primary allegiance to the State Governments would approach confirmation hearings of SCOTUS nominees that felt that it was the Federal Government's purview to prohibit the Medicinal Marijuana (which 11 states had as of *Gonzales v Raich*)?   Do you think they'd be as comfortable with an Attorney General who might be willing to act according to the President's whims rather than laws?

If you look at the increase in executive power since the Constitution was originally ratified, a significant amount of it came *after* the ratification of the 17th Amendment.    

That may indeed be specious correlation, but there's enough logic and psychology arguing to the contrary that I doubt it."
"Repeal the 17th that way the state governments are represented.

Expand the cap on congressmen to early 20th century levels. Also make it unconstitutional for the legislature to cede it‚Äôs power to the executive.

"
"Alright, here as few ideas:

1a. Number of Representatives determined by some algorithm based on the cube root rule. Round down from the cube root of total US population after each census in order to find the total number of Representatives.  Today that would mean a 675-person House, but you could minus the Senate for a House of 575 or multiply the cube-root by .8, .85, or .9 to keep House numbers manageable. 

1b. Adopt a form of proportional representation for House elections (either single transferable vote, an open list, or a decoy list-proof system of mixed member proportional). Based off the Seat Product Model found in the Shugart/Taagepera book ""Votes from Seats,"" even a moderate PR system should result in 3.5 to 4 major parties. More parties will hopefully result in more possibilities for coalition building. 

1c. Allow two-thirds of the House to pass legislation without Senate support, like in Japan. This has only happened in Japan only once or twice in 70 years, but their upper house doesn't distort representation as much as the American Senate. This should prevent Senators representing a small minority of the US population from blocking legislation desired by a supermajority of the population. In this case, a presidential veto would be absolute.

1d. Money bills originate in the House. If they fail in the Senate, the House and Senate sit in plenary session with each member of Congress being able to cast one vote. A majority vote passes the money bill. The Presidential veto can be overcome by an absolute majority of the Congress in plenary session. 

2a. Elect President by a proportionally elected Electoral College in order to simulate the consensus-building aspects found in proportionally elected parliaments while maintaining a slight small state bias.

2b. Allow Congress to overturn Presidential vetoes with an absolute majority in each house.  Under our existing two-thirds requirement, the President is able to act too much like a third legislative house--a house of one.

2c. Maybe--Cabinet members must receive and maintain the support of a majority of the House of Representatives. Regulations and executive orders promulgated by the President must be countersigned by the appropriate Cabinet member. This is a common requirement in most parliamentary democracies which a lot of political scientists more stable than presidential democracies. 

3a. Supreme Court justices serve for staggered 18 year terms ending 6 months after federal elections. Justices shall be nominated by the President and approved by two-thirds of the Senate. If a Justice is not approved within the time frame, the Senate shall nominate and approve two justices through a binomial system. Some parliamentary systems whose presidents are supposed to be nonpartisan, like in Estonia,  are elected by a two-thirds vote of the legislature.  A similar system for justices might encourage the nomination of wise nonpartisan jurists.  If such a lofty hope fails then the binomial system fallback would likely result in two partisans--one liberal and one conservative--that would cancel each other out.

There are many possible ways of adapting the US system to govern more effectively and responsively. However, there are many elite stakeholders, a minority of the country overall, who have a vested interest in maintaining a broken, unrepresentative system. Hopefully, the country finds a way to work for the benefit of all."
"We're two years into a [cut and dry](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/01/trumps-ethics-train-wreck/513446/) Emoluments Clause violation because political parties override the duty to hold up the law. Republicans are given no real incentive to enforce the Constitution, because the ramifications of holding a Republican president responsible are that they lose having had control over all three branches and having carte blanche. Now that they've lost the House but have kept the Senate, they still have no incentive. It's always been a case that political parties are a threat to checks and balances, and it's during eras of heightened partisanship‚Äîsuch as our own‚Äîthat we see this manifest. 

That's not how the framers discussed checks and balances in Federalist paper 51, nor in independent writings or speeches, nor even in the Constitution itself. 

Factions and factional identification are important within a free and pluralistic society such as ours, but this tendency toward not just binary but frankly unitary on so many issues is not worth the trouble. 

* Ditching first-past-the-post elections would be a start. As we've no doubt [all seen now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo), there are [better alternatives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd-9op64t2M) that are less likely to set the rules in favor of strong two-party system. 

* Additionally, absolutely killing gerrymandering and attempts at voter suppression are vital, because they accelerate partisanship. The price for waging war on democracy should be unthinkable. One person, one vote. 

* Speaking of, kill the Electoral College. Stop this nonsense where the general election is about winning over a few hundred thousand people in Ohio. Again, one person, one vote. 

* We need structures put in place to create both incentive to enforce the law over serving party and strong disincentive to putting party above country. This means more independent oversight. This means explicit rules instead of just implicit standards. This means unthinkable consequences. 

* We need to start pursuing **previous** administrations for wrongdoing. It should be a reality that when an administration leaves office a future administration of a different party or faction could start up investigations and can pursue justice. The US likely violated the UN Charter when we invaded Iraq and no one has been even investigated. Clinton, H. W., Reagan... all of them likely committed offenses which could have resulted in trials if not convictions. Being insulated by having a current majority should be no safeguard about being in the minority in the future. "
"I don't remember where I heard /read this, but the Founders thought that without parties, ambition would be the check of power. One branch wouldn't give up their power to another branch to prevent being seen as subservient to that branch. With parties, the calculus changes, who cares about giving up power of it's to your own team? Whoever I was listening to/ reading suggested that with parties, the checks have to be other parties - GOP prez = Dem congress and vice versa. "
The executive branch needs internal division to take power away from the president. The first step would be a separately elected attorney general(of someone who passed the bar) to run the DoJ and constantly+proactively investigate the highest offices in the country for corruption and law breaking. 
"It would probably be ok if the US wasn't FPTP. For example Republicans can't block Obama from appointing a supreme court judge if they make up 20% of Congress. Most parties would have to reject it, which would there's probably actually good reason to so so. It's much harder to abuse power and act in bad faith when you have to compromise."
"The seperation of powers has never worked as intended, because the system presupposes incorrectly that the house, senate and presidency would function as independent factions within the government rather than as battlegrounds for political parties.  

That flawed assumption has been poison in the well from the beginning, because the intention was to model the system after the English one, but without any hereditary titles in the mix.  The English system of the time was balanced between a hereditary monarch, a hereditary aristocracy and a peoples chamber, and was much more neutral on the issue of who actually held the reins of power than the way the system is implemented in the modern one.

The idea of seperation of powers was never that there would be no overlap between the functions of the government, but to overlap the powers in such a way that each branch could check the others.  That's why the president has veto power, which logically is a portion of the legislative function, and why the senate tries impeachments, which logically should be a judicial function, for just two examples.  Each branch has powers that do not belong in its category to give it power over the other branches and keep them in line.

The problem we have run into is not in the structure of the government, it is that faction has not manifested in the way that the system presupposes.  Binary systems are much more volatile, and also more intractable, than the trinary system that was envisioned.  Your car doesn't run very well if you put rum in your gas tank rather than gasoline.  Combine that with a legislature that has been immobilized by partisan politics and it's no wonder the executive runs roughshod over them."
"The Constitution is fine, if it was actually adhered to.

The Supreme Court, for example, is not given the right of judicial review in the Constitution. The system was never designed to set up in essence an unelected Court who's members are appointed for life that can literally strike down any law they wish and create any ""right"" they wish, with no recourse, other than Constitutional Amendment. The framers did not intend for the Supreme Court to have this power.. it was there largely to rule on disputes between states.

As far as investigations, Congress HAS the power to open their own investigations. They could created an Independent Commission to investigate anything they want. They did this for the 9/11 Attacks for instance. 

The Congress has the tools to reign in the President, if they want to. 

and the problem with the Supreme Court is that its been given too much power. They should not have the power of judicial review."
"I believe the documents are in excellent shape.  Anything which can withstand several generations of differing politics and even Civil War will be just fine.  IMO, America is simply 10-30 years overdue for a complete overhaul in political parties.  On that note, I suspect I will live to see the end of both Republicans and Democrats.  

IMO, simply removing the (D) and (R) from candidates would force voters to better vet those being elected and end the existing party rift which more/less ensures nobody is doing anything in office."
"To the first point about the Judicial I think that the process for appointing nominees should satay the same.  I don't want the masses electing judges.  We aren't qualified enough to do that.  I wouldn't mind seeing term limits, however.  I'm not sure how it could be implemented and they should be at least 16 years long.

The second point about the Mueller report is complex.  It was a far ranging investigation that concluded Trump did nothing illegal.  That doesn't mean that there wouldn't be politically damaging information in there.  On what grounds should it be released if the Justice Department concluded nothing illegal occurred?  I see the issue of the Justice Department reporting to the Executive but I just don't see how it would be fair to release the report before the election if there was politically damaging but not illegal information in there."
"So-called ""checks and balances"" have ZERO answer for when each branch is controlled by the same political party.  So-called ""checks and balances"" are not applicable across the three branches of government, only across the two parties, and only when the branches of government are held by different parties."
"I think our critical failure is that we have no ability to remove bad actors from government, thus undermining the checks and balances that already exist. 

We need to investigate strengthening the impeachment power for all branches. There needs to be a legislative recall mechanism, and presidential impeachment needs to be something that isn‚Äôt near impossible to do. 

I don‚Äôt think the imperial presidency allows for the level of transience that, say, the British PM is subject to, but when the consensus of most stakeholders is that critical failures are occurring at the hands of a politician, there needs to be appropriate recourse that doesn‚Äôt rely on good faith. "
"As long as we‚Äôre revamping the legislature, why have two houses anyway?

1) The whole idea of a separate state-based chamber was built for a time when state identities mattered on the federal level

2) Two chambers allows one to block the other for no good reason and then blame the other chamber/party for the lack of progress \*cough\* McConnell \*cough\*

Unicameral legislature elected by proportional ranked choice or bust. "
"It needs to restore them, including the most important one which is the separation of state and federal power.  We've been slowly centralizing power over the past 100+ years and it's gotten us to the mess we're in now.  There are really 2 concrete reforms I'd see done, and only one might require a Constitutional Amendment.

1. Repeal the national emergency law that lets the President bypass Congress if they can semi-plausibly claim ""emergency"".

2. Make whatever change is necessary to invalidate Wickard v. Filburn and strip the federal government of most of its domestic power.

Those two changes would fix almost all of our current disfunction because our current problems are almost entirely rooted in too much central power over domestic affairs.  We are a large and diverse nation and that necessitates local control over domestic affairs to prevent factional and regional conflict."
Probably not IMO. Executive branch has a big lead of the other 2 but legislative is insane if they had a clear majority.  Whips just should just be tougher or something. The Supreme Court is probably the most powerful court in the world so that‚Äôs been fleshed out well. 
"Under the special counsel regulations, Barr is only required to notify Congress of a few very narrow scenarios about the end of the investigation, including if he overrules Mueller on a decision. Beyond that, it‚Äôs up to him what to show lawmakers. It‚Äôs a very different situation than the one the nation faced in the 1990s, when independent counsel regulations mandated that Ken Starr send his report directly to Congress as well as to the attorney general http://amp.timeinc.net/time/5557096/william-barr-mueller-report"
"Officials who are unelected, have extreme power over everyone‚Äôs lives, and serve for life like the Supreme Court Justices just shouldn‚Äôt be a thing. They‚Äôre a roadblock to actual democracy and change, have been for a long time."
"Changing things like constitutions or separations of Powers should have a complete majority support setup.

To change or attempt to change anything during a time when the population and voter base, seems polar opposites of each other is the absolute worst time to attempt to change anything. Not only practically speaking, but in terms of instability and doing complete damage moving foreward.

And frankly when people are more united, and there are less differences between republicans and democrats. Everyone seems happy. So they inevitable don‚Äôt look for the most part to change things.

Now seriously.. why would you want to change something?

Also there is no neccesating reason to release everything. Trump has said he probably will open to it be released, with a lot more in the closet and other documents with it.

The transparency of the trump organization has been at an all time high. It‚Äôs  the most transparent presidency the USA has ever had."
"Congress still has loads of power.  The issue is that Republicans have decided to not conduct any oversight of Republican presidents, and that Trump makes a lot of noise, but basically does what Congressional Republicans want him to do.  He never vetoed any legislation while Republicans held Congress. And the Senate generally blocks any legislation that he might veto.   

McConnell's only agenda is to install conservative judges and cut taxes on the rich - which is what happened and is happening. 

In short, there's nothing that can't be fixed by...the voters. If there are bums, they must throw them out.  The biggest issue to the health of the system is Republican attempts to suppress voting, because that impacts the systems ability to naturally correct. "
"The only correct answer is that the current Constitutional order is ossified and in need of  drastic reform. 

There hasn't been an expansion of the House of Representatives since 1911-that's insane! 700,000 ppl per Rep is far too many! We should triple the size of the House of Representatives, proportional to the current population.

&#x200B;

I like Mayor Pete's idea for reforming the Supreme Court. The only thing I would add is a term limit of 22 years.

&#x200B;

As it regards the Mueller report, that has more to do with an abdication of power than the lack of power. Pelosi and Co. could more seriously investigate the president but have chosen not to. Same goes for the Senate. The Founders never dreamed of a congressional body which simply abdicated it's responsibilities, nor did it envision such a polarized politics. Again, we need drastic Constitutional reforms."
"We need a new constitution, its ridiculous we are treating a 300 year old document as infallible especially because the 'founding fathers' weren't all American nationalism gives them credit for (The Federalists, party of Washington, Adam's, Hamilton etc... straight up outlawed any criticism of government and did everything they could to monopolize power and we act these people created a perfect system?) Political theory has evolved soooooooo much since then, but because of nationalism tied to the document  this is blasphemy to say in this country. France may have had like 5 constitutions in its history but I think the end result is that France has a more stable, efficient and modern Government. "
"Yes. A few things must be done.

1. We need to seperate class powers. Currently, bribes buy elections. If it weren't for some creative thinking, the loophole of small-dollar donations wouldn't be fighting against that very problem right now. i.e. Justice Democrats, Our Revolution, RepresentUs, etc.

2. We need to democratize the workplace, where we spend most of our time. Employees must be included as owners who vote on business decisions and leadership. Currently, our employers make most of the major decisions in our lives. That includes when and where we will be spending our time. It often includes employers making decisions about how, when, and where we can spend our time outside of work too. 

3. We need the power to remove people from office by petition and vote. It truly is that simple. If our representatives knew they would be held accountable by the public, it would make a huge difference in the way they behave.

4. Rank choice voting. This is seriously underrated. It causes candidates to consider all of their constituents, especially in combination with #3 that I listed.

5. We need an anti-corruption agency as a fourth branch of government. It could be subject to #3 & #4. It would be a seperate branch whose sole purpose would be to publicly report on the other branches. It would have subpoena power and the power to see any and all government documentation."
"I don‚Äôt think it would be necessary to revamp the overall structure of separation of power if the individual offices were selected more justly.  

Here are a few ideas:
-Place limits and mandates on how sc justices are selected. (Reduce the number of offices congress can pick per term or increase likelihood that picked justices are ideologically centrist)
-expand number of sc justices
-dissolve the duopoly of the two-party system (Rank choice voting, reduction of gerrymandering, ballot access, etc.)
-Require states to allocate electoral votes proportionally, make process of selecting how states use electoral votes more democratic/dynamic, and/or provide alternatives to how President and supporting offices are selected
"
"term limits for justices wouldnt be a terrible idea. 

an investigation that produces a report should be available to the legislature and executive branch on every draft form available. none of this redaction nonsense. frankly if the legislature wasnt so impotent from its inability to rise above partisan BS, theyd probably find a way within the system as it cureently exists, to get the report "
"I think one answer that most people are forgetting is that even with a COMPLETE separation of power, big donors can sway people in legislative to pay people off in judiciary and just cancel out those separation of powers (i.e. a big donor swaying a certain politician/former attorney general from California who is swaying a certain State's Attorney for Cooks County, Illinois who allowed 16 felonies to walk free). This is happening all around us every day and the only way to create true fairness and a true separation of powers is to punish ALL the people who collude against the United State's and it's laws with a HEFTY fucking penalty. Remember, at every swearing in of a public official they take an oath that they ""will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and **domestic**""."
"No, but good question.  And good points, especially about SCOTUS.

1.) We need to:
   (a) Legalize marijuana
   (b) Reel in law enforcement

2.) Yes, some reasonable time limits on SCOTUS justices.

3.) Follow the law on who votes in the electorate, or eliminate it all together.  It‚Äôs in place to prevent people like Trump from being president.  I realize that statement may make some people mad, but that doesn‚Äôt mean those people are right, it just means Socrates was probably correct; we need to test everyone to make sure they are savvy enough on public policy to vote.

4.) Castrate special interest, and strengthen political parties.  Special interest only cares about nuanced issues.  Political parties cares about ideologies.  We are a nation of ideals, not nuances.

5.) Legalize pot.

Full disclosure: I don‚Äôt even take the pot, so I have no bias.  My bias is towards the out of control police tactics that include lobbying to keep pot illegal for the purpose of ensuring more cops are needed.  Another disclosure, I‚Äôm very pro union, and it‚Äôs the cop unions who are advocating for the continuation of tough pot laws.  That‚Äôs a conflict of interest."
"First off I would point out that this part is proven fake news and you should edit your post to either remove this or admit it is incorrect information.

 ""The second issue is the discussion this week over the Mueller report, and whether or not it should be released - and, more recently, whether or not the Executive (in this case the White House) should have the right to see it before the Legislature, and indeed potentially make redactions to it so that the full version can never be seen by the legislature.""

As far as the rest goes heres what I think.

Why after almost 200 years of it working is it a problem now? 
Amendments could be made by congress tho rare it does happen. "
I think the department of justice needs to be an independent agency of government.  The head of the department has to be selected and confirmed by a 2/3 senate vote.  In many states the AG is an elected official with powers outside that of the Governor.  That plus a 2/3 vote would insure both independence and also that the person selected is not some partisan hack.  
"Yes:  
First strike nuclear capability should be by Congress only. We do need fast retaliation capabilities for MAD, but there's absolutely no reason why a single person should be able to decide to nuke targets for no reason.

The House should not be capped, capping makes the House less representative, which is its entire point.

The Senate should not be able to block legislation if it has passed the House with a 2/3 majority. The point of not scheduling legislation is to prevent being bogged down by nonsense, but if it has passed the House with a 2/3 majority then it is not nonsense.

The Senate should not be able to block justice votes, including Supreme Court justices. Give them a reasonable timeline such as a month or two to hold a vote that should prevent being spammed with justice re-votes.

Pardons should be blockable with Congressional 2/3 majority vote. The Pardon power as it is now is too easily used to pardon friends of the President.

The problem is that most of these would require an Amendment to have any enforceable effect, and in the divided climate we have today, we are not going to get an Amendment.  
"
"I mean that‚Äôs pretty much any social contract though, no? When the mechanisms that ensure solid legitimate checks and balances break down due to faction, well...

See Federalist 10, ambition should be checked by ambition. The flaw is that on our day and age people have subordinated their power and ambition to the executive. It‚Äôs not necessarily limited to one party or another either. That being said, the republicans are worse about it than the democrats are. "
">  the Speaker of the House should fill much of the role the President does now, similar to a Prime Minister.

Can you explain yourself here please?

I think what you‚Äôre getting at is resembling a parliamentary or semi-presidential system, which I think would be a good idea, but the Speaker of the House isn‚Äôt anywhere close to the analog of a Head of Government (Prime Minister).  

In full presidential systems such as in the US, the President is both Head of State and Head of Government.  In parliamentary or semi-presidential systems, the head of government is usually a Prime Minister who heads up the governing functions of the executive branch, while the head of state is usually either a ceremonial role.  Parliaments still usually have a Speaker, just as Congress does.

If the US were to become more like one of those systems and split the role of the presidency, the President would remain Head of State while the Head of Government would be another executive role.. most likely the Vice President."
"That's my opinion as well. America has taken for granted the traditions of the office of the president and the peaceful transition of power that has been enshrined in our culture for generations.

Our constitution is in dire need of reexamination. There's a troubling percentage of the population who use the appeal to tradition fallacy to justify that the constitution is difficult to change by design and there are certain aspects of it that are elevated to near holy scripture levels of deification (1st/2nd amendment, etc). 

All I have to say is that perhaps a piece of paper that was drafted well over 300 years ago, by landed elite who represented the .01% of people living on the continent, that was immediately amended 10 times after being ratified, and once considered black men to be both property and 3/5ths of a person for the purpose of counting population is unsurprisingly a flawed document. There should not be as much resistance as there is to *discussing* changes to the constitution. If any particular vestigial clause or amendment can't stand up to scrutiny, maybe it's not in anybody's best interest that it be protected by the fallacy of tradition or deified by the laymen.

"Everything in society is dependent on faith, there is no escaping that. Money itself is dependent on faith. When a judge tells a cop to apprehend the defendant, he's acting on faith. You can't ignore the soul, whether you like it or not. The soul and character of the government will always matter"
">The US executive is wildly to powerful, but not even by design. Congress continues to surrender more and more power.

I'd argue that this is an unintended consequence of the design of Congress.

Congress's current design encourages inaction and gridlock. It is *incredibly* difficult to get Congress to take action on *anything*.

Congress's inability to do anything also prevents it from acting as effective check on the executive or judicial branches because that would require it to *do something*!

As such, it is only natural that every other part of the federal government would increase in power (at Congress's expense).

- Congress won't pass a bill to protect DREAMers, but it also won't stop the president from doing so.
- Congress won't repeal the ACA, but it also won't stop the courts from doing so.
- Congress won't regulate carbon emissions, but it also won't stop the EPA (the executive) from doing so.
- Congress won't authorize funding for a border wall, but it also won't stop the president from invoking a national emergency in order to do so.


All of these examples have the same result: **Congress takes no action, including the enforcement of their earlier inaction**.

Of course, this has a lot of consequences outside of placing a lot of power into less democratic institutions.

- The president can deescalate the threat of deportations, but they can't give them real legal status.
- The EPA can regulate carbon emissions, but it can't [price them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissions_trading).
- The courts can interpret laws, but they can't [make them](https://qz.com/work/1283730/the-us-supreme-court-ruling-on-worker-arbitration-dealt-a-huge-blow-to-the-metoo-movement/)

As long as Congress remains frozen, every other part of the federal government will increasingly feel compelled to take action instead."
"> and the Speaker of the House should fill much of the role the President does now, similar to a Prime Minister.

This effectively destroys the concept of an Executive Branch of government.

"Am I understanding it right that you want the US to function kind of like the UK, with the house as the house of commons and the Senate as the house of lords? That's an interesting idea that I haven't heard before."
"Some of it is due to necessity. As the issues facing government become increasingly complex, it is sometimes easier to pass legislation to give the executive branch the authority to take action (e.g. On pesticide regulation) than it is to expect most people in congress to be properly informed.

Add to that the fact that congress is beholden to the fundraising process and lobbyists, and you get the present day situation.

One necessary fix would be publicly funded elections. But of course, ""muh socialism"".

I also think that the government structure of the US is fundamentally flawed. The executive is underpowered domestically, and overpowered internationally.

Parliamentary forms of governments have a nice tradeoff between majority and minority governments, and most anglo sphere countries have short federal elections that can be called early if necessary. In short, the inflexibility of the US system has created a Frankenstein, all to pay homage to the outdated notion of a confederacy of states. "
"I‚Äôm glad this is so high. I had a thread about this kind of thing a little back, and someone mentioned the cohabitation system in France where the PM and President both work as a unit or check on each other. I believe the US system can do similar by:

‚Ä¢ giving the House more power

‚Ä¢ making the Speaker more like a PM/giving House Majority more influence

‚Ä¢ weakening Senate veto power (majority leader power)

‚Ä¢ restricting presidential power

‚Ä¢ increasing Supreme Court justices, and changing who nominates them (should be shared by Congress/SC themselves)

Edit: wanted to clarify some points. Speaker of the House should either be de facto head of government elected by the majority or should be given only Speakership power and the Majority Leader be head of govt. Also the president and House power points I think are important as they have only power granted by the Constitution, but continue to be exercised beyond limit (War Powers Act, for example, in its passing and supposed violations). "
"There shouldn't be a Senate. Full Stop. It was a short-sighted effort to get smaller states to not feel they'd be powerless back when the largest states had populations several times larger than the smallest states. Today the largest states have populations 20x-30x the smallest states. At this point, the Senate is well beyond any sensible attempt to level any playing field and is literally undermining Democracy itself. 

We should eliminate the Senate, the House should be elected to 4 year terms. The president should be elected for a single 8 year term with a cut-off that no one can be elected president if they would be over the age of 69 on election day. There shouldn't even be a Vice President. The successor to the president should just be the Speaker of the House. The Department of Justice should be under the direct supervision of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court should be limited to 20 year terms of service."
The check to the power of the supreme court is that they really only have the power to check the other branches. They can't legislate. They can't enforce laws. They can't control the military. That is their check.
"The Supreme Court are interpreters of the Constitution, which is the highest law of the land. Why would you want to check that power? I certainly don't want the President or Congress vetoing judicial decisions that are designed to restrict their power in accordance with the founding document."
"I think this is more a function of a failure on Congress than the Court.  Constant deadlock between two parties leads to large, hastily put-together legislation.  This legislation then gets a lot of challenges, so it falls to the Judiciary to mediate these challenges.  The way Ezra Klein of Vox.com puts it: when traffic is deadlocked, drivers still get to where they are going, they just use back roads to do it; in legislative deadlock, the ""back roads"" are the Judiciary.

I think the way to fix deadlock (and judicial overreach) is to reform the voting system (away from [first past the post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting)) and allow a multi-party system.  With more parties, there are more avenues for legislative movement and less need for bloated, challenge prone bills."
"I would argue the exact opposite. The Supreme Court is far and away the weakest branch, to the point of barely even being a real branch until Marbury v. Madison. The only way the Supreme Court Matters is if the other branches decide to make it matter by enforcing their decisions. This fact has basically driven the jurisprudence of Roberts, as he tries to avoid rocking the boat as much as possible in order to maintain the tenuous power of the court. See his ACA decisions."
"Excuse me hold on. I'm not sure you know how the courts work. Congress has near complete control SCOTUS so long as what they do is not counter to the constitution and even then there are potentially amendments (although recently for practical reasons this is less likey). But all they have to do is pass a law. They do it all the time. If SCOTUS makes a decision they dont like or interprets a statute in a way they didnt intend, they just pass a new law and it overturns the court case. So long as it doesnt violate the constitution, they're good. Just because Congress doesnt do this sometimes doesnt mean there's an imbalance in separation of powers."
There is a major check on their power - they have no enforcement capability.  Look at how liberal states do gun restrictions or conservative states do abortion restrictions - they'll flagrantly ignore rulings knowing that there's nothing that can actually be done about it.
That would require letting different states with different values live according to those values instead of according to the values of the high-density coasts and that is (apparently) simply unacceptable.  A return to federalism would solve almost all of our current political problems but one side of the aisle simply will not accept that as an option.
"> larger States tend to have more people for each Representative, as smaller States are still guaranteed 1 Rep

[The 10 states with the largest number of people per representative are Montana, Delaware, South Dakota, Idaho, Oregon, Iowa, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Missouri, and Mississippi.](https://www.thegreenpapers.com/Census10/FedRep.phtml?sort=Hous#table)  Those are not larger states.  Larger states tend to be near the middle and smaller states near the two extremes. "
">The whole ""winner takes all"" is not part of the Constitution, but an artifice of the States, whom the parties rely on to avoid having to spend resources campaigning in 60/40 States.

""Winner Takes All"" was a natural result of the Electoral College once a few states started realizing they could maximize their influence by allocating all their electors to the popular vote winner. This is why the Electoral College doesn't specifically favor small states despite what defenders and opponents say. It specifically favors states that could go either way politically hence ""swing states"". These states could be small, mid-size, or large (for example, New York use to be a powerful Dem-leaning swing state from 1960-1988 while also have the most or second most electors). This was a problem some Founders like Hamilton noticed and complained about. And the problem is, states don't really have an incentive to get rid of ""Winner Takes All""."
"> For a country that prides itself on checks and balances, the executive has unbelievably sweeping powers.

A lot of this stems from Congress having delegated to the Executive over time, not necessarily constitutional structure. That said, my current understanding is that the United States' nation-building efforts often involve a parliamentary system (not something mirroring the U.S. Constitution)."
"In a parliamentary system, the executive is just chosen by the majority coalition of ministers.  That actually leads to the prime minister having *more* power because the legislative chamber is on their side, just like we see here with Trump and the Republican Senate.

What would be great though, is borrowing their concept of ""a"" government.  The government is dismissed after time or certain circumstances.  We could *really* use a reset button on Washington right now."
"Meh, correlation isn't causation. Most developed democracies are in Europe, so whatever systems of government are popular there are going to make up the majority of those, while the rest of the world is peppered with dictatorships. Besides, South Korea has a strong President and they get along fine."
"On 3)

Congress is only crap because voters hate it when they take stands on things. Aka vote. ya know their job.

Either voters need yo be more ok with short term unpopular descicions by congresspeople, or we need to extend congressional terms to further insulate congress from voters."
"To add to that, the current administration struggles to work with Congress on getting any legislation pass. Even the annual budget was a struggle, where both branches of government had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the table to work out a compromise.

Congressional leadership **loathes** when POTUS tries to give it orders. Congress hates being given presidential orders with the fury of a thousand suns. Congress steadfastly refuses president orders out of sheer spite.

Ambition is indeed countering ambition. "
People really don't understand how sweeping the 17th Amendment's changes to the system were.  Taking away the States' voice in Congress is the primary reason that the Federal government has ballooned at the expense of local control.
"Because the Department of Justice is the attorney general - the guy the FBI Director and other *law enforcement* agencies answer to. They execute the law and investigate if someone has broken the law. 

Because the Judicial Branch only interprets the law, putting law enforcement under them makes no sense. 

Legislators write the law
Executives execute the law
The Judiciary interprets the law"

That is a *bad* idea. We don't want to make the stakes of politics throwing your opponents in jail. That's a dangerous precedent to start, and it will not be limited only to those who ""deserve it."" Imagine if Trump actually tried to ""lock her up."" 

>The US likely violated the UN Charter when we invaded Iraq and no one has been even investigated.

"Good first three points. The fourth is obvious but difficult to implement‚Äîall governmental mechanisms, to some extent, depend on good faith. However you're right that pursuing *something* in this vein is crucially important.

As for the last point though, while I see what you're getting at with the frustration that the war criminals of the Bush administration never faced any consequences, I am not sure what mechanisms could be put into place here that wouldn't be readily abused. Imagine if Trump, on top of having full Republican control of government, also had a viable way to persecute Hillary Clinton and Obama.

If criminals in elected government aren't being dealt with, the solution isn't to give more dangerous power to elected government. Perhaps the judicial branch should have its own enforcer with actual teeth and with power only to prosecute government officials. Or perhaps we just need to restructure the justice system to punish white-collar crimes more heavily in general instead of spending so many resources on locking up small-time drug offenders. But whatever is done, it can't be to give administrations the power to easily go after their former political opponents."
">We need to investigate strengthening the impeachment power for all branches. There needs to be a legislative recall mechanism, and presidential impeachment needs to be something that isn‚Äôt near impossible to do.

I disagree. For starters:

1. Individual states can and do have legislative recall mechanisms. Remember, representatives represent a district in their state ONLY. It's not a federal issue. Same thing with the Senate - they represent a whole state. Besides, Congress can vote to expel a member for misconduct. 
2. The impeachment process for POTUS is more than adequate. You need 67 Senators to agree to remove a President. This prevents simple majorities from getting rid of a president for purely political reasons. 

Overall, the system requires broad consensus to remove people from office without them losing an election. You do not want to lower that bar to make it easier. "
The entire point of the Supreme Court is to enforce the Constitution even when it‚Äôs unpopular. It should be at least one step removed from the electorate for that reason. We can‚Äôt have the people violating the Bill of Rights through popular vote.
"> Officials who are unelected, have extreme power over everyone‚Äôs lives, and serve for life like the Supreme Court Justices just shouldn‚Äôt be a thing. They‚Äôre a roadblock to actual democracy and change, have been for a long time.

While I have seen persuasive arguments for having fixed terms (around 18 years if I recall) for SCOTUS justices, you miss the point as you state it. If we have a U.S. Constitution at all, if we have fundamental rights not subject to the tyranny of the majority at any given time, if those things exist at all, we need a way to protect those rights (and those provisions) from the majority trampling the minority's access to them. To be clear, by ""minority"" I do not solely mean something like a racial minority. I literally mean a numerical minority (however one slices the issue at the time).

The judiciary as a branch (not just SCOTUS justices‚Äîfederal district court judges and circuit judges of the federal courts of appeals as well) is intended to be a safeguard against majority overreach into the baseline rights of Americans (or people more generally, depending on the issue).

I'm not sure I would say the courts have been agents of change, but it's hard to argue that *Brown v. Board of Education* was not part of a significant change (at least for society).

Consistency and stability in legal relations between parties (e.g., contractual rights and obligations) matter as well. Courts need to be free of political influence (or as independent of it as possible) to focus on the law itself (and not on obligations to political interests)."
"> They're a roadblock to actual democracy and change, have been for a long time.

Yeah, that's the whole point.  Unelected institutions like the Supreme Court (and to a lesser extent, longer-term elected institutions like the Senate) are designed as a braking system to prevent populist waves from changing the law willy-nilly.

If demagogues were able to change the law simply by appealing to the masses via lowest common denominator, the country would be a gigantic mess.  Popular sentiment is great as a vehicle for implementing change, but it needs to be appropriately steered and braked by sober-minded intellectuals to prevent the government from flying off the proverbial cliff."
"I'd argue that it's a good thing that Justices aren't elected. I think that past presidents have picked less politicized candidates than would be selected in a general election. I would prefer an even less political system but I have no idea what that would look like.

As to whether they should be life appointments, I'd be interested in hearing arguments from both sides. "
"Law is about LONG TERM cultural norms.

&#x200B;

So yeah.. It might seem to suck for you that the guy you don't like has a lifetime appointment. But the law is not really about you... The law, is about maintaining stability in a country over many many years. The sentiments that win more in elections over the years, do indeed reflect more the direction of the Lawmakers also.

&#x200B;

But again.. Presidential Elections are to appease and represent the people NOW.... The Legal system is to create stability, and slow change OVER TIME.. To create a strong CULTURE, that can not simply be 'replaced' at the whim, of a 'bad 4 years'..."

"I don't see any reason why the head of state and government need to be separated, but the Speaker of the House should be far more powerful and influential while the Presidency is more prestigious. The President could appoint the secretaries as desired, but then have them report the the Speaker or an associated committee. "
"I agree. The Senate needs to go towards a House of Lords style if anything, less direct authority over our legislation and more oversight and advising. I don't mind the senate having control over the Supreme Court nomination, the cabinet, etc, I just don't like McConnell's understanding that he can prevent a nomination by merely refusing to schedule anything. But I'm not sure how I feel about how much power they wield in regards to general legislation. "
"It's a power the Senate already has, bills have to pass both houses, and I'm fine with that. The House is elected every 2 years and reflects the current mood, but can also lead to short term thinking or give reactionary movements more power.

True democracy allows 51% of the voters to do anything they want to the other 49%. A system that isn't fully democratic forces the majority to pay at least a small amount of attention to the needs and desires of the minority. 

The system shouldn't be set up in such a way that a small cohesive minority can completely dominate the majority against their will, but that's why we have two houses of Congress that both have to agree on legislation before it becomes a law. One house represents the interests of the majority, one house represents the interests of the minority. "

"You are correct, we need to figure out how to get Congress to do it's job.  As for how, I don't know.  Maybe Term limits?  Maybe a congressional amendment making it tougher for Congress to give away responsibilities to the executive branch?  Ideally, we the people should hold Congressmen to do their job, in reality that hasn't worked very well."
"> What incentives should we give congress to do it's job.

An actual threat of losing their seat. The major problem in our system is that voters don't make informed decisions, so obviously unqualified people get to hold onto their seats forever.

"The reason why Republicans are so loyal to Trump is because he has power, and if they were to get on his bad side, they'd have no way of countering him; unlike a parliamentary system whereas any leader that doesn't abide by official party ideology gets thrown aside. Another plus is that you won't have so many different elections, and there wouldn't be a gridlock between a president that wants to pass a law, and a parliament that doesn't. "
"I'm not sure what lines you're talking about exactly, but has Trump really broken that many Presidential norms or set new precedents? Maybe it's easy to pin it all on him because of how he's using Presidential power to push through things that are immensely unpopular, but I don't think he's actually crossed any red lines. Congress has just been abdicating its responsibilities and shirking its duties due to gridlock for quite some time now, and that's led to an increase in executive power. Gridlock in Congress means more executive power, and that's cumulative with each successive President. Obama used executive orders, and so does Trump; Bush relied on national emergency declarations, and so does Trump. I don't think a Clinton presidency would have shied away from using executive power if Congress wasn't willing or able to do its job."
"The weimar republic for example, made the rise of a dictator extremly easy, as the president could already rule without consent of the legislature. That wouldn‚Äòt be as easy in a parliamentary republic. "
Most of Europe does not have a presidential system. Go look up an a list of presidential forms of government and pick out the ones that aren't back sliding towards a dictatorship or have slid to a dictatorship. 
"I believe the most important decision taken anywhere by anyone in the 20th century was the decision about where to locate the Princeton Graduate College. President of the University Thomas Woodrow Wilson wanted it down on the campus, integrated with the undergraduate college. His nemesis, Dean Andrew Fleming West, wanted it where it now is, up on a little hill overlooking the Princeton golf course. President Woodrow Wilson had one of his characteristic snits, resigned as president, went into politics and ruined the 20th century.

"That doesn't make sense in the current context. We have people like Steve ""what's wrong with white supremacy"" King in congress right now. Trump literally said there were good people in the Neo-Nazi group that was chanting ""blood and soil."" The current system obviously hasn't prevented Nazis from participating in politics or culture wars. If anything, it has given them undue power."
"Not only (as other posters have pointed out) has the current FPTP system not stopped us from having Nazi sympathizers in government, but you haven't even attempted to show how getting rid of FPTP would make the problem worse.

If anything, the presence of a Nazi-lover like Steve King is a result of the two-party system. His voters may or may not like that he's a white supremacist, but they think being a Democrat is worse than being a white supremacist so Steve King is guaranteed a general election victory every time. And in the primary, the party doesn't want to spend resources primarying their own, so the GOP has no incentive to stop him (to the extent they even see a problem with having one of their own be a white supremacist, which is a separate issue). In a non-FPTP system, it would be easier for a non-Nazi-loving conservative challenger to take him down."
"There are intermediate systems between ones that nearly guarantee just two parties and ones that nearly guarantee extremely fringe parties.

For instance this effect can be limited by the the number of members elected to districts or by setting adequately high voter share qualification thresholds."
"> If we have a U.S. Constitution at all, if we have fundamental rights not subject to the tyranny of the majority at any given time, if those things exist at all, we need a way to protect those rights (and those provisions) from the majority trampling the minority's access to them. 

The Constitution as originally passed didn't have any enumeration of rights.  It is absolutely possible to have a democracy that does not include protections for individual rights -- I just wouldn't want to be a part of a minority group in one."
"> While I have seen persuasive arguments for having fixed terms (around 18 years if I recall) for SCOTUS justices, you miss the point as you state it. If we have a U.S. Constitution at all, if we have fundamental rights not subject to the tyranny of the majority at any given time, if those things exist at all, we need a way to protect those rights (and those provisions) from the majority trampling the minority's access to them. To be clear, by ""minority"" I do not solely mean something like a racial minority. I literally mean a numerical minority (however one slices the issue at the time).

In fact this is actually a line of thinking you can trace back to the American founders. Jefferson and Hamilton both wrote stuff about tyranny of the majority, while calling the people ""a great beast"" that needed to be tamed. Or like in the debates on the Constitution, Madison pointed out that if elections in England"" were open to all classes of people, the property of landed proprietors would be insecure. An agrarian law would soon take place,"" giving land to the landless. The Constitutional system must be designed to prevent such injustice and ""secure the permanent interests of the country,"" which are property rights.

This is why the American liberal democracy and constitution as such just aren‚Äôt enough, they the fear of real democracy and a majority always looking to exercise its ‚Äútyranny.‚Äù 

>I'm not sure I would say the courts have been agents of change, but it's hard to argue that Brown v. Board of Education was not part of a significant change (at least for society).

"> but it needs to be appropriately steered and braked by sober-minded intellectuals to prevent the government from flying off the proverbial cliff.

This whole argument falls apart unless you believe that those in power are inherently smarter and more moral than the people they rule. If you believe that there is a class of people who should have more power over the governed than those beneath them, then why not just bring back the aristocracy?"
"I always thought it would be a good idea to have SC judges (or any judge that currently 'serves for life') to be limited to something like 12 or 15 years... maybe 20... and then whoever happens to be president at the time of the end of their term can decide if that judge is fit to continue serving.

Of course that becomes political, as a judge selected by a Democratic president would be removed by a Republican president... but then again, the entire process of assigning someone for life is currently political as well, and with the current process there's no remedy short of impeachment, retirement or death."

>So yeah.. It might seem to suck for you that the guy you don't like has a lifetime appointment. But the law is not really about you...

"Maybe, just maybe, if the Democrats have a completely losing platform for rural areas they should reassess why that is versus trying to change the rules to disenfranchise these people they lost? Just a thought. Because the continual efforts to change the federal system (attacks on the electoral college, efforts to reduce senatorial power and so on) sound a lot like assaults on our institutions which I'm frequently warned the Republicans do in spades. In short, you're asking the wrong questions."
"It actually wouldn't do anything now even if ratified. It maxed out at ""not be less than two hundred Representatives, nor more than one Representative for every fifty thousand persons"". Since we're well past 200 Representatives, the current Congress would still be Constitutional even with this amendment passed."
"I don't think that would be the case.  An independent Justice Department wouldn't have any more or less power than it does now.  If the Justice Department found that a member of the legislature committed a crime it would have to go to court like any normal trial (which is how it is now).  If a member of the executive committed a crime, the Justice department could recommend the legislature take up impeachment/fulfill investigative duties..  Same for the Judiciary.  As far as anyone else in the nation, it would remain exactly how it is now.  What would change would be that the person leading the Justice Department, the AG, would not be beholden the President, nor either party in congress as it would require 2/3 vote to be appointed to the position.  In practice, that would never occur with a partisan hack.  In order to get 2/3 vote in congress, anyone up for the job would have to be considered a fair pursuer of Justice without a political agenda.    


Right now the Justice Department is headed by the President.  Constitutionally, the President can run the show.  There has been a gentile men's understanding that the President not be too involved, but at the end of the day it's ""his"" Justice Department.  He gets to pick who runs it, and that person reports to the President.  That is a problem not only for instances where the President is suspected of committing crimes, but more generally in terms of application of the law.  Like I said, that could be avoided by divorcing the Justice Department from the power of the Presidency and by requiring super majorities of the legislature for appointments of the AG position.  I think it would result in more accountability and more trust in the Justice system overall.  "

"While I agree with you, I do not think the point was to demonstrate that the constitution is bad, but merely that it shouldn't be considered perfect and people should examine it to see what could be bad. As such, using example of how it was bad in the past are valid. It just show that it wasn't perfect and that scrutiny should probably be encouraged by laymen (instead of being nearly deified by many). A question about a part of the constitution should be deemed ridiculous, as if the constitution was perfect by design.

I'm not saying these are the best arguments for what I think the case is, but i don't think they aren't as invalid as you said."
"His arguments are not ad hominems. He isn't saying the Constitution is flawed precisely because it's 300 years old; he's pointing out the obvious fact that a small group of guys from 300 years ago did not have the eternal answers to all social and political problems. And he's pointing out how absurd it is for so many people to treat those guys' work with the reverence of religion, which is the central point.

What he's saying is that the Constitution is far from perfect (obvious) and that therefore we should not be afraid of discussing its flaws and ways in which it could be improved. Insisting that it must be held to at all cost is pretty much equivalent to insisting that all software must run on DOS (or insert your favorite archaic operating system here) because that's how it used to be. "
"> this is an attack on the ""character"" of the document, not it's contents.

It's absolutely an attack on its contents. First and foremost, it's an attack on how hopelessly outdated the Constitution has become. It doesn't account for any of the problems introduced by an industrial society, like pollution or a massive underclass of wage laborers. It doesn't address electronic communication (or electrical power in general). Its amendment process is not at all adequate for our increasingly rapid technological and social developments. It took the better half of a century for it to directly address the legality of slavery, and even then it failed (as the institution of slavery was perpetuated for several more decades after Reconstruction). The 13th-15th amendments were largely meaningless until the CRA was passed nearly 100 years later. Provisions for women's and LGB (no T, as of yet) rights largely have had to be patched in unofficially via the (equally unconstitutional) process of judicial review; those same decisions can be overturned. It doesn't at all address positive rights, only negative rights. It protects one's right to private property over in lieu of one's right to basic welfare, framing our entire legal system in favor of the privileged. Its electoral system is hopelessly undemocratic compared to most of the developed world. Not only does it not address corporate personhood, it's been tortuously interpreted in almost unanimous favor of corporate rights in a way that actively harms our democracy and legislative process regardless of the document's language or the founder's intent. Nearly everything about it is completely inadequate for dealing with modern life and politics."
"It's like you took the exact same position but decide to somehow argue against it.

They intend to control as many state houses as possible in order to **change the Constitution**. Checks and balances be damned, they damn near have succeeded. Trump makes so many people sick though that it's starting to backfire, and now you see this week that McConnell is trying to **speed up the confirmation process** to get as much done before the 2020 election - he sees the writing on the wall. And it's *still* going to be a heavy lift to change the course of this country because a Nunez or a Steve King or even a Trump can continue to be reelected - mind boggling to sane First-World Western countries.

"1000 member house would have been terrible in a time where everyone had to horse-and-buggy over to the Capitol to cast a vote in person.

"More power to the Dems temporarily, but eventually a split would occur with the GOP, reforming as a very likely younger, more diverse party.

Obviously getting the current GOP on board is difficult, but it solve a lot of our countries issues when people are properly represented."
"So basically the small states deserve to be over-represented twice, thrice over..? I was fairly certain the House represents the people and its the Senate that represents the states. But it seems like everything is about states: the presidential, the Senate, and the House?

There really isn't much a difference between Northeast Wyoming and Southeast Montana, or rural Alabama and rural Mississippi, aside from the fact that there is a straight line drawn in the sand that says they're different (unlike pre-Civil War, where states were much more unique, especially in the earliest days 1776 onward.)

"> The executive has power of foreign diplomacy

We need to have a chief diplomat.  Treaties can't be binding unless congress approves them.  Further, congress can specifically override the president, with legislation, to prevent him from entering into a non-binding treaty, or to pull us out of one that he's entered.

> and appointments

The majority of which need to be confirmed by congress.  Cabinet positions, Judicial appointments, heads of the three letter agencies etc.

> appointments as well as a veto

Which is, by design, a check on the legislature.  Further, the legislature can override the presidents veto if there is the political will.

Everything you mentioned has to get approved, or can be checked by three organs of the federal government (President, House, and Senate).  Hardly ""concentrating power""


You didn't list it, but the only real ""big ticket"" item that's been concentrated in the executive is war making powers, and even that is still subject to congressional approval."
"For that to work properly, the Senate would need to be somehow nonpartisan. Originally, with this in mind, Senators were appointed (not that I think THAT would help today). Since Senators are partisan, what they actually do is counterbalance a populist movement with whatever movement happens to be favored by some minority of the country. I don't see how this is an improvement in any way.

In its current form, there is no constructive purpose to having the Senate at all."
"Because it made a good sounds bite to deflect, and ignores his purpose. His proposal was to move it to after the lame duck session after the elections so it wouldn't be politicized during the elections."

"This is literally the problem the Senate was designed to handle,  not the House.  If the House doesn't give equal representation to individuals you effectively design a system with one Senate and one ""weak"" Senate."
"> I don't see any reason why the head of state and government need to be separated

You basically spell out such a separation in the rest of your reply.

In political science, the theory is that the HoS (head of state) embodies the legitimacy of the state whole the HoG (head of government) runs the day to day affairs of executive administration.    There is some inherit danger in combining the the two roles in one person, as is done in the Presidential systems used in the western hemisphere, as it can often lead to overly powerful executives and even dictatorship.

The Speaker of the House is a Legislative officer, not an Executive officer, so your scenario wouldn‚Äôt make sense.  The Speakership is already an incredibly powerful position, not to mention running the legislature is time consuming as it is. It would also be a major violation of the separation of powers.

A more appropriate manifestation would be, as I mentioned above, the Vice President taking on the role of HoG while the President remains HoS.  For example, their powers and duties might breakdown as follows:

President (Head of State)
- appoints cabinet secretaries, judges, and ambassadors.
- signs bills into law (retains veto power)
- presides over the Senate (tie breaking vote)
- convene/adjourn Congress
- commander & chief of the armed forces
- presents treaties to the Senate

Vice President (Head of Government)
- presides over cabinet secretaries
- appoints white house staff
- issues executive orders, rules, regulations
- directs law enforcement
- preparation of Federal budget
- oversees administration of Federal government
- generates reports for Congress"
"I wouldn't call that an override, that's consensus. Override world be the ability to pass bills over the House's objection. But anyway, now I understand that you meant.

Wishing that it'd be rare is nice and all, but the past couple decades have shown us that we can't design a framework of government around wishes. I wish the Senate didn't pocket veto a SCOTUS nominee for no better reason than ""our guy didn't pick him,"" and yet, here we are.

So back to the OP's question, if your proposed changes are to wish for better behavior, then I disagree that that's enough.

"Yeah they should make it like a 20 year term. Long time, but not a lifetime so that way presidents don't feel like nominating young guys in their 40s and 50s because they'd serve the same amount of time.

"They don't have to impeach to control SCOTUS. All they have to do is pass a law. They do it all the time. If SCOTUS makes a decision they dont like or interprets a statute in a way they didnt intend, they just pass a new law and it overturns the court case. So long as it doesnt violate the constitution, they're good. OP clearly doesnt understand how the courts work. Just because Congress doesnt do this sometimes doesnt mean there's an imbalance in separation of powers."
"They make the correct decisions way more often than they don‚Äôt.

"For single-member elections, I prefer [Approval voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting).  

If you're going to have a bicameral legislature (like the U.S. Congress and most state legislatures), then I think one chamber should be made up of legislators elected from single-member, un-gerrymandered districts using Approval voting, and the other chamber should use some form of [Proportional representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation).  

For the U.S. Congress, I would make the Senate the proportional chamber, and I would keep the House mostly like it is, but weight representatives to favor smaller states (since the Senate would no longer do this)."
"The weird thing is that average tenure of Congress is already about 10 years. POTUS has a maximum of 8. If anything, POTUS should be at the beck and call of eternally re-elected Congressmen. Presidents come and go but Senators and Congressmen are forever.

There is absolutely no reason, structural or otherwise, that POTUS has all of the power and Congress has none. Congress really does hold all of the power here, including power over warmongering presidents. POTUS can order the military to war but Congress has to pay them. Congress can decline to authorize funding.

"What about doubling the terms of senators and house members?

The house runs in 2 halves every 2 years with 4 year terms (so half the house is up every 2 years)

The seate runs every 12 years. Thus the congress is further insulated from the masses which are the group punishing action."
"Right. The problem is that congress figures that the easiest way to lose a seat is to do well anything at all. After all voters simply need not HATE you to keep you around, and the only way voters hate you is of you take a stand they hate. If you do nothing, no one cares.

At this point I almost want to say the problem.is the voters, and they aren't going to change, so the next best thing is to further insulate congress from their (misguided) wrath by extending congressional terms. Thus giving congress sone time to actually govern, and have voters somewhat forget positions taken by congresspeople."
Sure lots of different countries have implemented their own variations on the Westminster system - to better and worse effects. Many of the problems in EVERY form of democratic republic is getting a government that can still continue to function despite very divided opinions among the population and moderate populist swings. Many of the problems with both the US and with the UK systems are when the people who are supposed to be providing the moderating checks and balances ignore their duty to the country and continue with political ambition regardless. 
"Nothing you personally would consider a red line. But given what you have told me about your values I can give you an analogy that will at the very least help you understand how I view Trump :  the frog in a pot of boiling water. Mentioning each president claiming succesively more power, and executive expansion being presented as normal, is alarming, to me anyway. Especially when you consider that one of those lines was Obama - a decade and a half after 9/11, people born on that day learning how to drive and planning for college - deciding it was ok to drone strike US citizens on US soil.

Lincoln was brought up because he suspended Habeus Corpus, or in plain language he refused people right to trial. I am not saying it was wrong or even right. I am saying it is extreme. I am saying that is where my bar for crossing a red line is. This red line was not crossed again until FDR crossed it when putting asians in internment camps in Oakland.

What Obama did with his add ons to an otherwise routine NDAA was not in response to an immediate crisis, and had the effect of giving the President powers permanently that are much more terrifying than Habeus Corpus suspension. I am not concerned as much with whether the law says he can, I am concerned with the result.

So you ask yourself, given how I, a registered Democrat, view Lincoln, Obama, and FDR. You go ahead and apply my description of Obama and see if that applies to the use of emergency powers as a direct response to Congress telling you no, as a tool to do things they explicitly forbid you to do.

Even Nixon with the postal worker strike was acting in accord with the will of Congress. Even Bush had the immediate emergent change that was 9/11. I can't even think of a parallel where resources set aside for one emergency - Peurto Rico hurricane relief was a national emergency just like the southern border is - were raided to deal with another, especially when Congress gave resources that had not been used yet for that very thing.

I am not here to persuade you of any of the above though. I am not interested in your defense of Trump. If Trump has not crossed any lines with you, he did not.

Because you and I agreed on something more fundamental. The executive is indeed growing with every president that is in office. And eventually a President is going to do something that is terrible enough you will have to admit the water is actually hot."
"It also would never occur in the US. Weimar failed because they had a Chancellor who was head of government and a President who was head of state, as well as proportional representation system. When coalitions fell apart, as they naturally do is a pure PR system, the president was forced to rule by decree, including the power to make new laws. In the US the presidents power to actually make new laws is limited by Congress because executive orders aren‚Äôt laws, they just have the force of law. Basically executive orders can only tell departments what to spend their money on, instead of giving them new funds, which need the consent of Congress.

You are correct that one can build a government, and in substantial part the U.S. Constitution is mostly a governmental structure document. Yes, one can have a government structure document with no enumeration of individual rights. The United States does not have that. I appreciate the general sentiment here, but I'm not sure the pedantry is accurate.

"In the sense that human interaction is political, sure? And perhaps SCOTUS itself is prone to being the most political.

Of course American culture is good. And it has gotten progressively better every single year it has existed. From the Black rights movement of Martin Luther king and moving on. You will argue it 'took too long'...
But let me remind you that slavery existed since before Ancient Greece.

If anything, the Trump Admin has shut its inner-workings behind a veil of secrecy in order to hide its large number of conflicts of interest.   The Trump White House keeps its visitor logs secret, refuses to release the guess list at Trump's Mar-a-Lago, has issued multiple gag orders for agencies in order to keep them from issuing information and data against their official narrative, has continuously attacked and threatened the media,  has yet to release Trump's tax returns, has had multiple members of his team/admin refuse to disclose foreign contacts until after they were discovered, not longer holds daily White House briefings, actually barred reporters from recording WH press briefings, set the record for the longest span without press briefings... the list goes on and on.


Far from being the most transparent, the Trump Admin only begrudgingly releases information and tries to keep the American public in the dark about its inner-workings as well as who has access to Trump."
"That doesn‚Äôt really mean transparent. Just because they are scrutinized and found to be not guilty of something doesn‚Äôt mean they were forthright with information. 

Russia investigation: lied at **every** opportunity, beginning with ‚Äúno one has ever met with any Russians‚Äù. We also still don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in the report. Plus, he had a meeting with Putin and couldn‚Äôt be bothered to brief our own intelligence agencies on it. 

I never heard of the Ukraine thing. 

You did forget that he was actually implicated in a felony campaign finance violation, as well as having had his charity dissolved due to malfeasance. Not relevant to transparency, but still. 

As far as *transparency* goes we still have yet to see his tax returns or the contents of the folders from when he supposedly divested from his businesses. That‚Äôs like step one. 

His schedule is full of vague ‚Äúexecutive time‚Äù where he claims to be having meetings and doing President work but manages to echo Fox News in real time, almost inexplicably. 

I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs necessarily the most *opaque* in history, but they sure as hell aren‚Äôt the most transparent. 
"
"You're misrepresenting the summary of Mueller's report which explicitly (paraphrased) 'does not exonerate' the President.

The investigation produced convictions of people working for/with Trump. You cannot handwave that as hot air.

Maybe he didn't conspire with Russia, but he's thoroughly a con man and possibly a criminal. 

No reason to have general confidence in what Trump says or does. The President serves this country. So you set the bar low in saying his transparency invalidates the public's (well-placed) interest in the report.

And the irony is that withholding the report is probably the single most damning action he can take in the context of his administration's 'transparency'.


Rebuttal > V"
"> Please explain how its NOT the most transparent?


You can _absolutely_ make the case that it's one of the most scrutinized but in fairness, transparency requires some sort of preemptive action.  

Getting your name dragged through the mud and coming out clean isn't a preemptive action on Trumps part.
"
"In the current system, we replace the co-partisans who don‚Äôt want to check him with opposing partisans who do. (Hello, 2018 midterms!)

In a better system, you design it such that misconduct investigations aren‚Äôt conducted by partisans. If such a thing is possible, of course. "
"Honestly if you read their letters and addresses they really did see most of this (the importsnt bits) coming. 

-all of them hated political parties because of what we are seeing now

- Washingtons farewell address talks about a bunch of the ways people will try to attack our union"
The thing that concerns me about his re-election next year is that Kentucky Democrats don't really have anyone with name recognition that can stand against him. So I see him getting another term. I only hope that other states manage to flip the Senate so he will be stripped of the majority of his power.
"Besides the rhetoric, what damage has he done?  Reid sticks out for me on actual damage as he nuked the filibuster late in the term just over a few easy judicial nominations.  Extremely shortsighted as the it was right at the election year and Republicans had an historic 9 seat pickup in the Senate without losing a single seat of their own.  Just what they needed for their slight majority to get Gorsuch and Kavanaugh."
"Its a long con by the confederate states. Make the union so dysfunctional that it collapses under the weight of it's own bureaucracy.

Being less facetious, he's an incumbent that had displayed a remarkable ability to deflect issues.  Hell, remember when he rammed a bill through Obama's veto, then blamed Obama when the bill backfired?  It shouldn't be a surprise that he gets re-elected.  "
If you fundamentally believe that every person should have an equal voice then the House needs to be expanded and/or reallocated.  Anything else is antidemocratic and is intentionally taking power away from the people.
"Or maybe instead of considering any effort to remove the cap on representatives as an effort to 'disenfranchise' rural voters you should consider them as efforts to re-enfranchise voters in large states, which is what they are. 

The cap on representatives hurts Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Ohio as much as it hurts California, New York, and Illinois."
"Maybe, just maybe, if the republicans have a completely losing platforms for the major cities with the majority of the people in them they should reassess why that is versus breaking the spirit of the laws to disenfranchise these people they lost? "
"The US is far more centralized now than it ever was, and the senate only really made sense back when states were to be far more independent than they are now. And with this new, more federalized US, it only really makes sense to treat the country as a homgenous blob - and therefore, reduce the senate's power. Whether or not this federalization was a good thing is a different question, but it is what it is.

Edit: I meant unified/centralized, and not federalized."
"Why does it make sense to appeal to a minority and dwindling population? The two senators per state rule already leads to smaller states having disproportionate representation, the Permanent Apportionment Act further increased small states sway. Why should these fewer and fewer voters continue to set the country's agenda? "
"Couldn't you make the case that the house being capped fundamentally undermined the say of the urban states? Especially with the amount of electoral votes being tied to house seats. I'm ignorant of the history around why it was done, but it really seems to me this is the real bug in the system that's finally catching up with us."
"Well, firstly assaults on our institutions is something that we should have as we progress. We used to not directly elect the senate. And we used to not directly elect the president. Electorates just hide for us. So we have changed our election system. It‚Äôs not an assault. And secondly, have you seen the last two times the electoral college had failed, it favored the right,"
"You mean that Republicans have losing platforms for rural areas, which encourages people to move to cities to seek better opportunities.

Stacey Abrams ran her campaign last year specifically on saving rural hospitals, opting into Medicaid expansion, and fighting middle class tax hikes. All of which would have been good for rural voters. Meanwhile, the GOP continues to attack the wellbeing of immigrants, women, minorities, workers and consumers."
"Democrats already wildly do cater to rural and conservative voters. Thats why the democratic party is so conservative, especially in the senate. Senators like Jones or Testor are not nearly as liberal as their fellow democratic senators from other, more liberal states. "
"You're forgetting that a VAST majority of the day-to-day governance of the US is handled not via legislation, but by executive departments who can issue rules, regulations, make rulings, then investigate and prosecute people for violations of administrative law that never once saw a legislator's desk.  Congress has passed a whole variety of open ended ""Statutory Grants of Authority"" empowering an executive department to issue regulations in the Code of Federal Regulations, which have the force of law in most cases."
"> You didn't list it, but the only real ""big ticket"" item that's been concentrated in the executive is war making powers, and even that is still subject to congressional approval.

That needs to be reigned back for real. Article I Section 8 Clause 11 specifically gave Congress the sole power to declare war. "
">We need to have a chief diplomat.

&#x200B;

In theory we have a secretary of state. When Kerry, for instance, was in that position his major achievement was the Iran Deal, which Trump reneged on. That was a major diplomatic accomplishment.

The problem is that the Secretary of State is on the executive cabinet, rather than a member of the Senate or House, as they would be in a parliamentarian system, which means the SoS answers mostly to the president, and sometimes to congress, but never directly to the people of the United States. This is largely true for the entire Cabinet, of course, and one of the big reasons why the Executive is so strong. "
"Its not about McConnell, but rather how the entire position of both Speaker and Majority Leader have evolved. These two individuals have complete veto power at bringing any kind of legislation to the floor for a vote, they have ultimate veto power, more powerful, I would say, than even the President, who is the only one who explicitly is given that authority. 

&#x200B;

There needs to be a method wherein a majority of seated members of whichever branch can bring legislation to the floor for a vote. Or at the very least, there needs to be a means by which bills that pass committees are guaranteed consideration in a timely fashion. The Majority Leader/Speaker vetoing a motion (or even a nomination, in the case of Obama attempting to nominate Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court) by simply NOT SCHEDULING THINGS is pretty much an unacceptable and in my mind, obvious, loophole that needs to be dealt with.   


But to be completely honest once McConnell is gone there really is not guarantee that whoever replaces him will be any better, not without substantive changes to how things are brought to the floor and how confirmation hearings are scheduled. 

&#x200B;"
"Right, but no one gets to directly vote on the Speaker other than the constituents of their district. The entire House voting on them is in practice little different than the Electoral College, with the exception that there isn‚Äôt a charade of the popular vote meaning anything.  

The process for removing a President is intentionally difficult to preserve the separation of powers and to ensure stability. A number of parliamentary systems in countries that we think of as stable (Japan) go through an insane number of PMs due to rapidly changing coalitions in the government. "
"One interesting change in the CSA's constitution was term lengths and limits. In the CSA, presidents would serve for 6 years without possibility of re-election. It was a one and done deal, but the one term was longer than the USA's presidential term.

I think the CSA might have been on to something with changes in term length and limits. Obviously the CSA president was never able to finish even his first term, but the idea of a lengthy single term might have some merit. This gives the person elected to office more time to do what they're going to do but they cannot be re-elected. They don't have to worry about running for re-election or fundraising. They have only limited time to accomplish all of their goals and thats it, they're out of office. They'd better focus on accomplishing their legislative mission quickly."
"Yes. But Congress can still override that veto if they really want the EPA to be taken out of the president‚Äôs control. In most situations, Congress can take back the powers they have ceded to the executive some way or another."
With the way the courts have been filled the judiciary will become a pawn of the legislature anyways. There is also the precedent of a weaker judiciary. It is another branch that has gained power significantly. Having an odd number of Supreme Court justices for example. 
True but I also don't think we need an exact match of anyone else's government. We've got decades/centuries of data from which we can make improvements.  I'd advocate having proportional representation through multi member districts with either a parliamentary or presidential system.  I imagine that would reduce gridlock or make it so that the gridlock that did occur was because of a genuine split in the will of the people.  
"Great write-up, definitely gave me something to think about.

For what it's worth, I'm disappointed in myself for writing something that could be interpreted as a defense of Trump. By saying I don't think he's crossed any red lines, I meant he hasn't done anything that would make me think American democracy is in danger, but a ""red line"" like that is maybe something I should reevaluate."
"So the rise of hitler was enabled by.. seperate positions for head of state and head of government? What? 

I would say that a disfunctional constitutions (with the main flaws being emergency decrees, power of the president, extremly weak L√§nder, destructive vote of no confidence) and ignorant conservative elites (von Papen, Schleicher), as well as general unrest and multiple coup d‚Äò√©tat (Krupp-putsch, Bierhallputsch), as well as popular figures using conspiracies as a popularity weapon (Kriegsunschuldlegende, Dolchsto√ülegende, all of which Hindenburg supported). "
"I don't think you're getting the core concept. There are presidential systems and parliamentary systems. Most of Europe is the latter of the two. Most presidential systems don't survive a decade. Because, the executive eventually takes over and nullifies one or both of the other branches. 

For example, packing their court system with judges. "
"> Most people do not have anywhere near the understanding of economics to assess the qualifications of people on the FED. Just look at how hated Volcker was by most people at the time.

Most economists don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about either and stick to ideological movements that benefit the rich. We have economic crashes like every decade but thank god people don‚Äôt vote in someone who isn‚Äôt a neoliberal hack.

>Beyond that you could do permanent damage to the country by electing unqualified people.

The ‚Äúqualified‚Äù people have had their chance and ruined enough that I feel confident that the ‚Äúunqualified‚Äù should get a shot."
"> And secondly, have you seen the last two times the electoral college had failed, it favored the right,

OH THE HUMANITY!

Just because the election didn't go your way doesn't mean that the electoral college failed.  It did exactly as it was designed to do.

It's fine to argue that you want to change the system because you think it should be different.  But it's hard not to think you're only wanting to change it when you're whining that your opponents won based on the ruleset of the time.
"
"This sounds like it works out well.

Although the more I think about it the more I wonder what the problem would be with allowing a justice to delegate their own replacement to fill out the remainder of their term in the event of their retirement, or possibly even conditionally in the event of their death.

This way justices would not be nearly so compelled to keep working when they're old or in failing health or losing interest in the job. The vacancies wouldn't last very long and you wouldn't get these hugely divisive unanticipated confirmation battles. Extra appointments wouldn't become election issues. The original justice would tend to be less interested in boosting their own political capital or using the replacement as a political wedge.

When someone gets a term it's because they're expected to serve it for a full 18 years, but when they can't someone as similar as possible seems like the next best thing, and who would be better to make that selection than the original justice?

I also don't think it strictly has to be a term limit if the next president up wants to select the same justice for a second term, which would become more practical with the delegation system."

"Ofcourse it is. He was not lying in the end. The media became a joke all by itself. 

And honestly, he is the only president that pushed and pitbulled through on every promise he made.

What‚Äôs more rediculous is how they obstructed a simple border wall.. and the madman still passed it."
"It doesn‚Äôt even matter if it is possible in today‚Äôs social climate. Over half the nation (who even bother voting) has given up on any sort of reasonable critical thinking in regard to political issues and there seems to be no getting them back.

If you somehow *did* conduct the perfect investigation, I don‚Äôt think we would care enough for it to affect our actual voting, so they have no incentive other than honor (which...lol) to do things in a just manner. We‚Äôve lost our way as a people. Greed and intellectual laziness rule us."
"Parliamentary systems are much more robust to political parties, because they are built around them. Not that we can seamlessly switch to a parliament, but it's not like a democratic institution that's robust to the machinations of parties is a pipe dream."
"Washington hated them, but that didn't stop us from immediately splitting into federalist and anti-federalist camps. Jefferson, Hamilton, and Adam's were all staunch partisans. Maybe not as much as we are today, but they pretty much took Washington's warning and threw it out the window."
He was instrumental in moving the entire republican party away from governing and into obstruction. He said himself he made the entire focus of the republican party making Obama a 1 tern term president by working to stop literally any attempt at governing with all their power. Hes also the backbone behind nearly every trump admin decision. And he stacked the court.
"Well the devil's advocate question for you is if say 4 out of 5 people are urban dwellers, when would the 1 out of 5's wishes ever get respected when they differ? Is that an improvement?

Now do the same thought experiment with ANY minority population which can be brute-forced outvoted. "
The cap on the House does not inherently disadvantage big states.  It primarily disadvantages small states that barely miss the cutoff for having an extra rep (while advantaging small states that barely make the cutoff for having an extra rep).
"It‚Äôs kinda funny that you say ‚Äúmore federalized‚Äù, and after reading through I understood your meaning, but since the trend has been towards a more unitarian state since the civil war it would actually be more appropriate to say we‚Äôre becoming less federalized today.  

Confederation - Federation - Unitarian

The articles of confederation created a confederation of sovereign states, while the constitution created a federal republic of shared sovereignty between states and a general government, and then the civil war and new deal era really began to chip away at the federal character of the republic, edging somewhat towards a unitarian state.

There was actually a backlash to that in the form of New Federalism, so it‚Äôs kind of a cyclical ebb and tide.  I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll ever actually see a fundamental change to the shared sovereignty doctrine that underpins the current republic though.  The national government can‚Äôt just ‚Äútake away‚Äù the state‚Äôs sovereignty without dissolving the legitimacy of the union and perhaps even sparking a civil war.  

 North America would dissolve into several smaller, weaker sovereigns that would be easily manipulated by foreign powers; which is exactly the same shared fear that compelled competing factions in the Philadelphia Convention to overcome their differences and forge a novel federalized design."
"Let's say 'Republicans have losing platforms for rural areas' is 100% true (ignoring your incredibly simplistic good vs evil take on politics)- how does this follow? 'which encourages people to move to cities to seek better opportunities'- you think it's partisan politics that are causing urban migration? 

"
"The majority of the country believe popular vote should decide who wins the Presidency.  The electoral college is an unpopular joke, and needs to be removed so that the people voting are fully represented."
"The federal government may have started as a supranational union of sovereign state, but it has since evolved into a single federal state.  Compare US federal spending at 20% of GDP to a modern-day supranational union--the European Union at 1% of GDP.  Even though the US has evolved into a rather unified country with a very integrated economy, culture and politics, it still has the institutions of a supranational union."
"Its a union yes, but is it a 100% equal union? No offense to the small states, I don't mean to bully them, but states like New York, California, Texas, and Florida output most of the economy and harbor most of the population. Why should they not have, you know, a larger amount of influence? "
